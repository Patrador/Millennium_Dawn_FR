 italy_news.2.o2: "What an Interesting Development."
 italy_news.3.t: "The Roman Empire is back!"
 italy_news.3.d: "It sounds like a writing prompt, but it is reality.

Since the creation of the EU there has been a huge development of the countries who agrees to Schengen, Eurozon, but by unifying the whole continent under a single government and banner, Europe will finally show to the world that the old powers are still to be considered on par with the growing economies of Asia and America. The last step towards European unification has been taken."

 italy_news.9.t: "Italian war on Mafia is a failure!"
 italy_news.9.d: "Apparently, news coming from Italy tell us that not even the biggest of their attempts ended up into finally eradicating Mafia from Italy. The feared criminal organization's counter-attacks to stop the Italian government from cutting their powers proved to be enough to make Italy stop messing with them, effectively stopping the 'war' on Mafia."
 italy_news.9.o1: "We had to"
 italy_news.9.o2: "Interesting development"
