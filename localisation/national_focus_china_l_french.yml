 PRC_anti_corruption:0 "Anti-Corruption Measures"
 PRC_anti_corruption_desc:0 "As much as our state media denies it, communist governments tend to be pretty corrupt. This is especially so in China, as the recent growth in the economy has allowed thousands of nameless ministers to illegally enrich themselves with profits that should be going to the Party. Of course, while we are going about arresting the men skimming of the top, we can make a big public campaign about it. The people will think more money will be spent on them now, and that should keep them happy."
 PRC_industrial_safety:0 "Industrial Safety Laws"
 PRC_industrial_safety_desc:0 "What allowed us to become the modern workshop of the world was allowing our people to work in brutal conditions no western nation would accept, and all for virtually no pay. As much as the more benevolent men within the Party might want to change this, doing so would weaken China’s position as a rising superpower. Still, we can offer minor concessions and make sure people know all about what the government is doing to protect them. That should calm down any thoughts of protesting their conditions."
 PRC_educational_development:0 "Education Development"
 PRC_educational_development_desc:0 "China is a very large nation, both in area and population. Because of this, our education system isn’t the best. Our schools tend to be underfunded and undermanned, cheating is rampant, and our constant demands for political indoctrination seem to be getting in the way of proper learning. If we wish to take the mantle of leading world power from the Americans, we need to begin to address these concerns to make our education system the finest in the world. Except for the political indoctrination. That stays."

 PRC_public_services_desc:0 "Our cities are massively inefficient. Traffic Jams may last days on end, trash tends to pile up, and pollution is high.

 PRC_research_initiatives:0 "Research Initiatives"
 PRC_research_initiatives_desc:0 "Frankly, it is insulting to the Chinese spirit that most modern science comes from the Western World. Our various reforms have begun improving the Chinese education system, but more needs to be done. We should set up a program with very large rewards, both monetary and otherwise, for Chinese researchers who make scientific breakthroughs. Our nation is massive, surely we have one Steven Hawking or two around somewhere to compete with the West."
 PRC_diplomatic_initatives:0 "Diplomatic Initiatives"
 PRC_diplomatic_initatives_desc:0 "Our economic might, and ideological differences from the west, will allow us to gain many allies in nations that do not feel comfortable with the current world order.

 PRC_trade_deals_desc:0 "The west might not like to acknowledge it, but most nations outside of Europe and North America only align with them for financial reasons.

 PRC_educational_exchanges:0 "Educational Exchanges"
 PRC_educational_exchanges_desc:0 "There is a whole lot of countries out there, and that means a whole lot of students. We should help our Universities do Educational Exchange Programs, to send our students abroad and welcom foreigners to our country. Not only will the students bring in new knowledge from the outside world, but the foreigners we welcome will spread good words about China back home."
 PRC_economic_liberalization:0 "Economic Liberalization"
 PRC_economic_liberalization_desc:0 "It seems that not many countries are happy with doing educational exchanges with China, or cooperating with Chinese companies, while the government maintains absolute control. Perhaps with should pass some reforms to loosen our control in the economy, to incentivize people more and give ourselves a better image overseas."
 PRC_free_markets:0 "Free Markets"
 PRC_free_markets_desc:0 "Well, our recent economics reforms has pushed for new demands from our young private sector. Several would be businessmen, no doubt influenced by outside ideas, have presented the government with a brand new reformed system for our control of the economy. Basically, we will allow quasi free market economic actions to take place inside the country, but the government will retain total authority in any exchange involving a foreign party. Not only will this discredit foreign propaganda about our totalitarianism, it will increase the efficiency of our economy much more."
 PRC_african_initiatives:0 "African Initiatives"
 PRC_african_initiatives_desc:0 "The nations of Africa have been impoverished for centuries. Not many nations really prospered by European or Asian standards, and their time as European Colonies, while certainly helpful for their modernization, didn’t help them develop too much. Its been decades since de-colonization, and many nations’ infrastructures are in disrepair, relying on old colonial roads and railways. If we begin organizing investment funds for several of these nations, we will have gained many new friends."
 PRC_east_african_trade:0 "East African Trade"
 PRC_east_african_trade_desc:0 "Eastern Africa is often ignored by the west, and the nations of the region would be very grateful to have the option to trade with China directly. We should draft proposals for trade agreements with Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda."
 PRC_east_african_development:0 "East African Development"
 PRC_east_african_development_desc:0 "Our new African Partners are very grateful for our proposals, but they cynically still think this is little more than us taking advantage of their poor position. We should show them our goodwill by helping them develop. Let’s modernize their railways and manufacturing capabilities. We should send some industrial engineers to take core of this, have the Interior Ministry of Industry compile a list of candidates, and we will send them abroad."
 PRC_south_african_trade:0 "South African Trade"
 PRC_south_african_trade_desc:0 "The southern tip of the African Continent is in an especially poor situation. Besides the nation of South Africa, the other nations in the region have been plagued by war and poverty, and they would very much welcome sudden investments from Beijing into their countries. South Africa itself probably would like it too."
 PRC_south_african_development:0 "South African Development"
 PRC_south_african_development_desc:0 "We set up some symbolic operations that will help our partners on their day to day running of their countries, but we need to do more to secure their loyalty. Modernizing their roads, building railways, and bringing some small manufacturing to the region will have them kissing our feet."

 PRC_african_mining_interests_desc:0 "The Europeans colonized Africa because of its massive natural wealth. Colonization has gone out of style, but we can very easily help our African Partners set up better mining operations in exchange for very benefitial trade deals with us.

We should propose this to them."
 PRC_one_china:0 "One China"
 PRC_one_china_desc:0 "Well now that we are open and friendly with Taiwan, and now that we have both made compromises for peace and mutual stability, we think we can come up with a deal that will let us have de facto control of the island whilst letting them keep some of their 'freedoms'.

 PRC_south_sea_negotiations:0 "South Sea Negotiation"
 PRC_south_sea_negotiations_desc:0 "The South China Sea is rightful Chinese territory, but it seems like Vietnam and the Philippines don't recognize that.

 PRC_south_asian_alliance:0 "South Asian Alliance"
 PRC_south_asian_alliance_desc:0 "Our new friends would be very useful for our alliance. Their militaries might not compare to the PLA, but their geography will give us a strategic advantage should we chose to, say, put pressure on India for the Chinese territory they illegally control."
 PRC_aid_india:0 "Aid India"
 PRC_aid_india_desc:0 "Sure, they may be a degenerate democracy, and we may have our issues with their borders, but India is also a rising superpower with a very large population and a respectably large army.

 PRC_indian_alliance:0 "Sino-Indian Alliance"
 PRC_indian_alliance_desc:0 "Let's formalize our friendship with India by inviting them to our Alliance.

 PRC_state_media_apparatus:0 "State Media Apparatus"
 PRC_state_media_apparatus_desc:0 "Beijing has controlled all media in China for a long time now. Even foreign media allowed to operate in China is heavily limited and manipulated by the government.

 PRC_to_serve_the_people_desc:0 "The average person seems to have trouble believing that the People’s Liberation Army is here to protect and serve them above all else. Making some meaningless but symbolic programs for the PLA to do minor things for the average person will make people respect them more, increasing recruitment. Plus, there is a chance some soldiers might buy into it, giving them better conviction in combat, as they are the ‘last line of defense for the people of China against oppression."
 PRC_neo_maoist_doctrine:0 "Neo-Maoist Doctrine"
 PRC_neo_maoist_doctrine_desc:0 "Holding that ‘Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun’, Chairman Mao’s rhetoric seems like just what we need people to be thinking right now.

 PRC_xinjiang_security_operations_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the most obvious threats, let’s set up operations to make sure this does not happen again. Wiretap everything, set up military patrols 24/7, have paid spies. Every citizen in the region must be watched by the government."
 PRC_border_security:0 "Border Security"
 PRC_border_security_desc:0 "Part of the reason the Uighurs are such a threat to us, is because they identify more with their Central Asian neighbors than with the Chinese people. We need to do something about these countries, that give them such ludicrous ideas of rebellion. Our borders with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are awfully weak. Now, we could attempt to close down the border and increase security, but if we are gonna be sending the PLA over there anyway… we might want to just… renegotiate those borders. Peacefully. After we march on Bishkek and Dushanbe."
 PRC_tibet_media_blackout:0 "Tibet Media Blackout"
 PRC_tibet_media_blackout_desc:0 "It seems like the Tibetan people aren’t very happy about being part of the People’s Republic. The government has some ideas on what to do in the short term, but there is not much we can do with all those pesky news crews everywhere. Let’s get those cameras off, and then we can talk. The West probably won’t like this, but hey, who is the rising superpower here?"
 PRC_demand_dalai_lama:0 "Demand Dalai Lama"
 PRC_demand_dalai_lama_desc:0 "The Dalai Lama is regarded as the true head of state of the super religious nation of Tibet. Of course, this is laughable, especially because of that funny typo. ‘Tibet’ is a funny way to spell ‘Western China’. We have been trying to alienate nations from respecting him, but his actions have increased the people of Tibet’s calls for independence from China. He currently resides in exile in India. We should try and apply pressure on India’s government to hand him over to Chinese authorities."
 PRC_southern_border_adjustment:0 "Southern Border Adjustment"
 PRC_southern_border_adjustment_desc:0 "Well, while we are on the subject of dealing with India, we do have that embarrassing territorial dispute with them.

 PRC_one_china_concensus:0 "One China Consensus"
 PRC_one_china_concensus_desc:0 "Its difficult acting like a world power when you have a government-in-exile right next door. The Taiwanese Government, descended from the Kuomintang Government Chairman Mao overthrew in the revolution, is a thorn in our side. We need to more thoroughly enforce our demands that any government wishing to maintain diplomatic ties with us, break ties with Taiwan, and vice versa. Taiwan won’t like that, but in the end, it won’t matter."
 PRC_demand_rightful_territory:0 "Demand Rightful Territory"
 PRC_demand_rightful_territory_desc:0 "We must make it clear to the Taiwanese that we do not intend to sit idly by forever and let them be de facto independent. We WILL claim their island, and we WILL get it in the end. Still, there is no need to be so blunt. For now, we can negotiate a reasonable agreement, where they agree to de facto recognize us as the Chinese government, and we agree to not meddle in their internal affairs."
 PRC_final_ultimatum:0 "Final Ultimatum"
 PRC_final_ultimatum_desc:0 "These political games with Taiwan were fun and all, but playtime is over.

 PRC_nine_dash_line:0 "Nine Dash Line"
 PRC_nine_dash_line_desc:0 "The Nine Dash Line refers to our various claims across the South China Sea. Sadly, the rest of the world doesn’t seem to respect them, because they think our ancient maps showing Chinese control of the regions are not sufficient for modern territorial claims. We must begin to make it clear to the world we will enforce our claims in the region by force, if necessary. The nations of the Pacific probably won’t like this very much, but that’s an issue for the Foreign Ministry."
 PRC_xisha_claims:0 "Xisha Claims"
 PRC_xisha_claims_desc:0 "Xisha, also known as the Paracel Islands in the west, are a group of islands in the South China Sea.

 PRC_nansha_claims:0 "Nansha Claims"
 PRC_nansha_claims_desc:0 "The Nansha islands, or the Spratly Islands in the west, are another group of islands in the South China Sea. This time, its the Philippines that have an issue with our controlling our rightful territory.

 PRC_vietnam_border_adjustment:0 "Vietnam Border Adjustment"
 PRC_vietnam_border_adjustment_desc:0 "The Vietnamese may also be our comrades in the Marxist Revolution, but they are very bad ones. First, they had the audacity to fight us in a war after they threatened our Cambodian allies. Then, they aligned themselves with Moscow over us, and now, long after the USSR is gone, they seem like they wish to align themselves with the west! We cannot tolerate this. Fabricate some incident in their border, we must take Vietnam. A true communist revolution means that there can not be two communist states anyway."
 PRC_east_sea_territory:0 "East Sea Territory"
 PRC_east_sea_territory_desc:0 "We have some territories in the East China Sea that are sadly not flying the Five Star Red Flag.

They are rightfully Chinese territory, but the Japanese claim them to be part of the Ryukyu Islands, and the Taiwanese claim that, as the ‘true Chinese Government’, the islands actually belong to them. We cannot allow the Japanese, who so greatly hurt and humiliated the Chinese people in the Second World War, to hold even a single inch of Chinese Territory! Prepare a statement. Japanese Authorities will withdraw from the islands. Or else."

 PRC_naval_rearmament_desc:0 "Unless WWIII just happens to start, the PLA will only be good for border conflicts and for internal operations. To project our power elsewhere, and potentially actually fight, we will need a good navy. Let's begin drawing plans to create new, modern Battleships first."
 PRC_littoral_defense:0 "Littoral Defense"
 PRC_littoral_defense_desc:0 "Battleships look flashy and pretty. They make our navy look strong. But realistically, we can't just rely on them. Smaller ships are critical for the PLA Navy to be efficient. We should continue funding our Naval Modernization Committee to design new small ships."
 PRC_submarine_development:0 "Submarine Development"
 PRC_submarine_development_desc:0 "In the event we have to fight another large navy, we are gonna have to be able to sabotage their logistics operations, and be able to strike at any point. We are gonna need new submarines. These days, they are often used just as nuclear missile launch platforms, but in an actual naval war, they will be invaluable. Let's get our engineers up to the task."
 PRC_carrier_navy:0 "Carrier Navy"
 PRC_carrier_navy_desc:0 "Carriers are today's Man-O-War. They are how countries project their naval power, and their military investments. American carriers rule the seas, and if we expect to pass them, we must design and deploy new, more modern carriers. Relying on Soviet models is not fitting for a rising superpower anyway."
 PRC_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
 PRC_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Carriers are only as good as the aircraft on them. We need to try and adapt our advances in aerial warfare for our carriers, and make our fighters and bombers capable of being used on carriers. Let's get our Naval and Aerial Military Engineers to coordinate."
 PRC_blue_water_navy:0 "Blue Water Navy"
 PRC_blue_water_navy_desc:0 "Our ships may be new and shiny, but we really need to change our focus on how to use them now. Our Admirals must be provided with our technological advances so they may provide new ideas for our navy. Have them draft some potential new tactics and give them back to the Central Government, ASAP."
 PRC_northern_infrastructure:0 "Northern Infrastructure"
 PRC_northern_infrastructure_desc:0 "Well if our economy is growing so rapidly, we must ensure the regions around our capital have world-class road and railway networks. Beijing is already a large city, but its infrastructure must become the envy of every western nation if we wish to be treated as a serious player."
 PRC_northern_industry:0 "Northern Industry"
 PRC_northern_industry_desc:0 "There is a lot of places for our industries to grow, but what place would be better than right next to where our economic planners already live? They will be able to more closely micromanage certain industries, and we shall be able to enjoy an expanded economic influence in areas with the most direct influence from the Central Government."
 PRC_northern_military_industry:0 "Northern Military Industry"
 PRC_northern_military_industry_desc:0 "Producing televisions, cheap cars, toys, and other cheap consumerist crap for the western markets is what brought us wealth, but as every government knows, you can’t be a serious world power without a whole lot of guns. Let’s start building factories that can build rifles, tanks, and helicopters."
 PRC_eastern_infrastructure:0 "Eastern Infrastructure"
 PRC_eastern_infrastructure_desc:0 "The majority of the Chinese population lives in the coastline. Mobilizing these workers into factories will allow us to outproduce any other nation on earth. Of course, this will take time. Let’s begin by building road networks linking all the critical cities together for easy transportation of goods."
 PRC_eastern_industry:0 "Eastern Industry"
 PRC_eastern_industry_desc:0 "Roads have been built, its now time to begin setting up factories. Let’s start with simple consumer goods, it will let us work out any kinks in factory planning for this region before we build anything critical, and the increased availability of TVs and the like will likely placate the local population."
 PRC_eastern_military_industry:0 "Eastern Military Industry"
 PRC_eastern_military_industry_desc:0 "Its nice to know the people of Qingdao can get ever so slightly cheaper TVs now, but let’s be honest, its time we put the new industry to good use. Let’s set up factories that will start pumping out tanks and other equipment for the People’s Liberation Army."
 PRC_southern_infrastructure:0 "Southern Infrastructure"
 PRC_southern_infrastructure_desc:0 "We must not let regions far away from the capital be left in disrepair. At least not coastal regions easily noticeable by passing shipping. We should begin building new roads near Guangzhou, to make it more like what the government would like the whole country to be. Plus, in the event of an invasion, it is likely to be the first place attacked if Korea is not a factor, so ensuring we will have good logistics there is crucial."
 PRC_southern_industry:0 "Southern Industry"
 PRC_southern_industry_desc:0 "Shipping goods all the way down the coast is a drag on the economy. Setting up some consumer goods factories there will allow the southern provinces to produce most of what they consume, opening up more industry to be used by the government for our needs."
 PRC_southern_military_industry:0 "Southern Military Industry"
 PRC_southern_military_industry_desc:0 "In the event of an actual war, being able to produce equipment locally should cut down on logistics issues and help get vital equipment to the field as fast as possible. We should help the southern provinces begin manufacturing military equipment."
 PRC_hainan_naval_development:0 "Hainan Naval Development"
 PRC_hainan_naval_development_desc:0 "China’s military strength comes from its massive number of soldiers. They will serve us well in a war. However, the truth about modern warfare and the politics of Great Powers, is that power projection is just as important as actual military might, and, unfortunately for us, power is best projected by a strong navy. We must begin to expand the Navy immediately, and building new ports and dockyards in the southernmost region of Hainan will be a great start. Plus, it let’s us project power on our claims in the South China Sea."
 PRC_central_infrastructure:0 "Central Infrastructure"
 PRC_central_infrastructure_desc:0 "The population may decrease in number and density away from the coast, but we still need to modernize the region. A decent number of factories may be set up there, and its always important to have good logistics. Let’s being modernizing the highways and railways heading westward from Beijing."
 PRC_central_industry:0 "Central Industry"
 PRC_central_industry_desc:0 "We may often forget, but there actually are people living in the center of our country. Frankly, it is doubtful that they will match the economic importance of cities like Shanghai or Shenzhen, but producing consumer goods there will mean more of what is manufactured in the coast can be exported instead."
 PRC_central_military_industry:0 "Central Military Industry"
 PRC_central_military_industry_desc:0 "It, of course, makes the most sense to produce our equipment in bigger cities, but moving our military production away from the centers of consumer products manufacturing means that, in the event China is ever invaded, or our military production suffers from sabotage, some production will remain safe and stable. Plus, it will be harder to track down by foreign spies."
 PRC_western_infrastructure:0 "Western Infrastructure"
 PRC_western_infrastructure_desc:0 "Getting goods to the western most regions of our nation is a major strain in the economy. Roads are filled with holes, trains are inefficient, and by the time they get there, many goods are damaged. We need to rectify the situation at once. Let’s begin fixing the transportation network in the west."
 PRC_western_industry:0 "Western Industry"
 PRC_western_industry_desc:0 "Better transportation has begun to alleviate the issue, but now we can go even further. If we set up some factories in the west, it will decrease the amount of goods that has to be transported there in the first place, letting us have greater control of more civilian industries that currently exist."
 PRC_western_military_industry:0 "Western Military Industry"
 PRC_western_military_industry_desc:0 "Sure, producing military equipment in Yunnan might not be the most efficient way to get guns in the hands of PLA soldiers, but it is sure to keep them hidden from enemy eyes, and will help supplement equipment damaged or lost by PLA forces stationed in the west."
 PRC_xinjiang_infrastructure:0 "Xinjiang Infrastructure"
 PRC_xinjiang_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most of Chinese infrastructure is very subpar once away from the coastal cities, it is just a fact of life in China. However, infrastructure in the region of Xinjiang is way below standards, even when compared to that of the central regions. We must rectify this national embarrassment at once! Trains to Xinjiang must begin to run on time!"
