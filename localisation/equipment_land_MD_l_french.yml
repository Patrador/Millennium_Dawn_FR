 UKR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Awtomat Kalaschnikowa 47 was an assault rifle inspired by the German Sturmgewehr 44 and was first introduced in 1947. Until the 1960s, it would become the main firearm of the Soviet Red Army and was also widely used among Soviet allies and among Soviet-backed insurgent groups. The AK-47 would become the most manufactured assault rifle of all time and is considered one of the most cost-efficient and most reliable weapons to this day."
