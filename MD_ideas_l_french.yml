The ROC has sought to retain the loyalty of the few states that continue to recognize it, but it is fighting a losing battle.

This overlap has led to substantial friction between China and countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and to a lesser extent Malaysia. The stakes in this dispute are high due to the strategic location of islands like the Spratly and Paracel islands and the presence of oil in the region.

Until recently Russia was aided in this goal by China, with the strategic partnership of both countries helping to undermine American hegemony. However China's great power aspirations have undermined Russia's position, as the Slavic giant has been forced out of its Central Asian sphere of influence by Chinese money.

 #Hong Kong
 Basic_Law: "The Basic Law"
 Basic_Law_desc: "The Basic Law was the founding document of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. Among other things, the document outlines the status of Hong Kong relative to China, granted it autonomy in all matters other than defence and foreign affairs, both of which are entrusted to the central government."
 One_Country_Two_Systems: "One Country Two Systems"
 One_Country_Two_Systems_desc: "Hong Kong has been guaranteed 50 years of autonomy from direct Chinese rule. The model of one country two systems allows for a preservation and indeed growth of many of Hong Kong's treasured political freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of public assembly. The absence of these rights in the mainland is a significant driver behind support for the "pan-democrat" camp in Hong Kong politics, with many concerned Hongkongers remaining wary of greater integration with mainland China."
 Triads: "Triads"
 Triads_desc: "When the communists took power in China huge numbers of triad members fled to the British territory of Hong Kong for safety. In the following decades powerful triads such as the Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On and 14K triads have run protection rackets, gambling dens and other illicit activities. Despite their anti-communist roots, the triads have also started supporting Chinese interests in Hong Kong due to business connections on the mainland."
 Localist_Movement: "Localist Movement"
 Localist_Movement_desc: "Ever since the handover in 1997, tensions between mainland Chinese and Hongkongers have led to the development of localist "Hong Kong First" sentiment amongst some local Hongkongers. This sentiment views communist China's political system with distrust, but also views Hong Kong people as culturally distinct and indeed superior compared to the people of China. The rise of this movement from the 2014 Umbrella Movement onward has changed the previously more measured tone of the Hong Kong political divide into one that is more emotive and radical."
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage: "Lacks Universal Suffrage"
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "While the Basic Law calls for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council to eventually be elected by universal suffrage, this eventuality has yet to come to pass primarily due to China's concerns about what may happen if the significantly more popular pan-democrats take control of the government."
 Limited_Universal_Suffrage: "Limited Universal Suffrage"
 Limited_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "China has agreed to allow the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to be elected by universal suffrage, on the condition that candidates must be vetted by China first. This is widely seen as a move to reduce the likelihood of pan-democrat or localist candidates becoming Chief Executive."

 NKO_nuclear_tests: "Nuclear Tests"
 NKO_nuclear_tests_desc: "Every few years the DPRK conducts nuclear weapons tests. This has drawn widespread condemnation by outside powers, including China despite its close relationship with North Korea.

 #International Recognition
 Non_State_Actor: "Non-State Actor"
 Non_State_Actor_desc: "Many international actors, from rebel groups to NGOs, possess international significance but are severly disadvantaged in a number of different ways by virtue of not being recognized states. Some of these non-state actors aspire to take control of an existing state by overthrowing an unjust government or to fashion a new one and redraw international borders. Others have no ambition for statehood, but instead use blunt force to accumulate power and wealth in local environments where the authority of the central government is absent."
 Lacks_International_Recognition: "Aspiring State"
 Lacks_International_Recognition_desc: "Some states possess everything you would normally associate with a state. A bureaucracy, a military, a national flag and so on. However, their statehood will never be complete without the added benefits conferred by the stamp of legitimacy of international recognition. These states may seek to acquire this recognition by campaigning for their cause overseas, with the eventual aim of winning the support of a critical mass of states in order to become full members of the international community."
 rival_government: "Rival Government"
 rival_government_desc: "Civil wars over control of the entire nation tend to produce two or more governments that claim to be the legitimate representatives of their people. This government is one that makes such a claim, but is disadvantaged by the fact that its status as legitimate representative is only recognized by a few other states, if any. It therefore does not represent its nation at international forums like the United Nations."

 #Myanmar/Burma

 ASEAN_Member_desc: "ASEAN is a primarily economic intergovernmental organisation based in Jakarta that was originally established in 1967. It has since expanded to include those countries that were originally excluded in the tense environment of the Cold War, and has sought to counter the growing influence of China as well as maintain independence from the West. It is committed to the principles of multilateralism, international law, peaceful dispute settlement, non-interference and self-determination."
 Rohingya_Crisis: "Rohingya Crisis"
 Rohingya_Crisis_desc: "Rakhine state has seen occasional outbursts of violence between Muslims describing themselves as “Rohingya” and local Rakhine Buddhists as well as the tatmadaw. The often brutal treatment of the Rohingya by the state of Myanmar has drawn strong condemnation from human rights organisations and Western countries, while Buddhist Nationalists in Rakhine state and elsewhere in Myanmar see the violence as a justified measure against illegal Bengali immigrants."
 Ethnic_Insurgencies: "Ethnic Insurgencies"
 Ethnic_Insurgencies_desc: "Since independence Myanmar has been engulfed by ethnic insurgencies in its remote, isolated border regions. Ethnic groups including the Karen, Kachin, Shan and many others see the central government as overwhelmingly Burman and Buddhist and so have taken up arms to preserve their unique ways of life."
 Democracy_Movement: "Democracy Movement"
 Democracy_Movement_desc: "Since the protests of 1988 the popular will for liberalisation in Myanmar has been strong. This support for democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi increasingly weakens the Tatmadaw’s once firm grip on power."

 A_Political_Military_desc: "Ever since the 1962 Burmese coup the Tatmadaw has been the dominant force in the politics of Myanmar. A disdain for civilian rule, democracy and freedom of speech on the one hand and a unified military culture shaped by decades of intense counterinsurgency warfare on the other have combined to produce a cohesive and politically active military. Signs that this is beginning to change have only recently begun to emerge."

 State_led_economy: "State-Led Economy"
 State_led_economy_desc: "While most of the world views liberal democracy and free-market capitalism as the necessary condition for economic development, the successful examples of South Korea, Taiwan and others points to the need for a strong, militaristic government to provide the foundations for growth."
 Buddhism_Official: "State Religion: Buddhism"
 Buddhism_Official_desc: "Having a state religion may appeal to some of the most devout Buddhists, but there is a reason for Burma going through most of its history without one. Having Buddhism as a state religion antagonizes those who subscribe to Christianity, Islam or one of Burma's many other religions. Having a state religion severely exacerbates tensions between the central government and the various often non-Buddhist ethnic rebel groups."
 ASEAN_Defence_Treaty: "ASEAN Mutual Defence Treaty"

 Chinese_Involvement: "Chinese Support"
 Chinese_Involvement_desc: "Despite being nominally supportive of Myanmar’s central government, China maintains a pragmatic attitude towards the conflict between government and rebels, maintaining close links to those rebel groups that control those regions of Myanmar that border Chinese territory. These links allow rebel groups to benefit from Chinese material assistance."
 Low_Chinese_Involvement: "Low-Level Chinese Support"
 Low_Chinese_Involvement_desc: "While only the United Wa State Army receives significant amounts of material assistance from the Chinese central government, many other rebel groups benefit from Chinese involvement in Myanmar more indirectly. These groups buy arms from other groups that get weapons from China, and enjoy close connections to Chinese businessmen and provincial officials who often visit rebel headquarters and attend their events."
 Disrupted_Chinese_Involvement: "Disrupted Chinese Support"
 Disrupted_Chinese_Involvement_desc: "The efforts of the central  government’s “secret war” have reduced the ability of the Chinese to provide support to rebel groups. Nonetheless, the assistance continues."
 Strategic_Capital: "Strategic Capital"
 Strategic_Capital_desc: "Yangon was deemed too vulnerable a capital for a security-conscious state like Myanmar to have. The relocation of the capital to Naypyidaw means that in the event of an invasion by a powerful external enemy, the Tatmadaw can continue to direct a people's resistance from a more secure location."

 JAP_deflation_desc: "§YInterest rate on debt:§! §G-9%§!\n\nFollowing the 1987 Tokyo Stock Market Crash and the burst of the 1992 Asset Price Bubble, Japan's economy has been in decline. With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight."

 swiss_political_system: "Political System of Switzerland"
 swiss_political_system_desc: "Switzerland has a very unique political system and is the only country in the world that can rightfully call itself a 'semi-direct democracy'. Citizens can change the constitution per referendum, can veto laws per referendum, can even pass laws per referendum.\nThis has implications for politicians however: Because the people make the policies either way, the Swiss coalition system has to include as many forces as possible. The four big parties of Switzerland, SVP, FDP, CVP and SP, are constantly in government together - this makes national elections in Switzerland more or less useless - as the people rule not through their representatives, but through referendums."
