 #Needs rework
 MD4_election_campaign.0.t: "Election campaigning heating up as race enter final two weeks"
 MD4_election_campaign.0.d: "The since last election on [Root.GetLastElection], [Root.GetLeader] have been steadily steering [Root.GetName]. With the final votes being cast in 2 weeks, this direction will be challenged by powerful rivals.\n\nMost of the campaign's advertisement spending has already happened, and polls are starting to pick up the effects."
 MD4_election_campaign.0.a: "Let's go!"

 MD4_election_campaign.1.t: "Foreign Policy Debate: [Root.GetLeader] faces tough priorities for who to attack"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.d: "With the final voting drawing ever closer, we have to make a decision on who we should contrast ourselves against in terms of foreign policy in this election. With the world a increasingly tumultuous place, the issue has become more important to voters than usual.\n\nSome hard hitting negative ads will for sure make their popularity tumble, but there is a small chance they may successfully counter this if they have some serious dirt on us, or if our attacks were based on very poor opponent research.\n\nThe effectiveness of the attack is determined by the amount of campaign funding we received."
 MD4_election_campaign.1.a: "Attack the main opposition within our own outlook"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.b: "Attack the [Root.GetFascistParty] lunatics"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.c: "Attack the Nationalist idiots"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.e: "Attack the [Root.GetNeutralParty] fools"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.f: "Attack the [Root.GetCommunistParty] imbeciles"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.g: "Attack the [Root.GetDemocraticParty] morons"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.h: "Refrain from attacking anyone"

 MD4_election_campaign.2.t: "Negative ad campaign against opposition a failure"
 MD4_election_campaign.2.d: "While our barrage of ads had some initial effectiveness, the opposition has unfortunately successfully countered it. Several of our claims turned out to be based on bad information at best, and the outrageousness of some of the claims have turned public opinion against [Root.GetLeader], with the conversation instead being turned towards \"[Root.GetLeader]'s unkept promises and lack of substance\". "
 MD4_election_campaign.2.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.3.t: "[Root.GetFascistParty] recover strengthened from attacks"
 MD4_election_campaign.3.d: "Despite ferocious attacks against them by us, the controversial Salafists have managed to retain all their core followers, and they used the increased attention following the negative ads well, gaining unprecedented access across all major news outlets to push their ideology."
 MD4_election_campaign.3.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.4.t: "Negative attacks against the nationalists backfire"
 MD4_election_campaign.4.d: "Despite ferocious attacks against them by us, the controversial nationalists have managed to retain most of their core followers, scoring major points across the nation on how the system is broken and corrupt, the mainstream media is manipulating society, and how [Root.GetLeader]'s policies are available for purchase to the highest bidder in return for campaign contributions."
 MD4_election_campaign.4.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.5.t: "Negative attacks against [Root.GetNeutralParty] fail to make impact"
 MD4_election_campaign.5.d: "Despite our best efforts, public opinion have turned against our negative ad campaign against the [Root.GetNeutralParty]. We speculate that there may be several reasons, but a key one may be that a politician of [Root.GetLeader]'s stature even giving them attention them were seen as \"attacking down\", and the increased attention allowed them to reach out to more voters."
 MD4_election_campaign.5.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.6.t: "Negative attacks against [Root.GetCommunistParty] fall on deaf ears"
 MD4_election_campaign.6.d: "Despite our best efforts, public opinion have turned against our negative ad campaign against the [Root.GetCommunistParty]. We speculate that there may be several reasons, but a key one may be that a politician of [Root.GetLeader]'s stature even giving them attention them were seen as \"attacking down\", and the increased attention allowed them to reach out to more voters."
 MD4_election_campaign.6.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.7.t: "Negative attacks against [Root.GetDemocraticParty] backfire"
 MD4_election_campaign.7.d: "Despite our best efforts, public opinion have turned against our negative ad campaign against the [Root.GetDemocraticParty]. While we have publicly blamed foreign interference, the real reason is that the attacks were so blown out of proportion so much that only a few people believed in them in the first place."
 MD4_election_campaign.7.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.8.t: "Invite controversial speaker to join on the campaign trail?"
 MD4_election_campaign.8.d: "Normally, this would not be suggested, let alone taken seriously. But due to [Root.GetLeader]'s low approval rating, it might be a risk worth taking. The speaker is a fringe member of our party, known for speaking his mind at inopportune times and has previously made numerous controversial statements. However, he is very popular among students and young people, a key group we need to convince to vote our way."
 MD4_election_campaign.8.a: "Invite him and hope for the best"
 MD4_election_campaign.8.b: "Don't risk it"

 MD4_election_campaign.9.t: "Large stunning rally reinvigorates enthusiasm for [Root.GetLeader]"
 MD4_election_campaign.9.d: "The rally was a great success, with the largest turnout of the whole campaign season. Not only did the controversial speaker heap praise on [Root.GetLeader] and preached party unity, he did it in such a convincing and enthusiastic manner that nobody even suspected it was [Root.GetLeader] who had written his remarks in their entirety."
 MD4_election_campaign.9.a: "A much needed boost for the campaign"

 MD4_election_campaign.10.t: "Disaster for [Root.GetLeader] on the campaign trail"
 MD4_election_campaign.10.d: "With the greatest turnout of the campaign season, the stage for [Root.GetLeader] to shine was set. Unfortunately, the invited controversial co-speaker intended to whip up enthusiasm proceeded to tear up the speech we had pre-prepared for him, and instead held a long tirade about the \"failures of all administrations, including this one\", and held an appeal to the youth to \"vote with their heart, or stay home\". \n\nNeedless to say, this was subsequently rotated heavily in the media, with our opponents gleefully watching on."
 MD4_election_campaign.10.a: "What a failure!"

 election_coalition_won.0.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Elections: Government Coalition gets majority!"

 MD4_election.4.d: "With all the votes counted, [Root.GetLeader] does not currently have a majority in the new parliament to form a new government. Additional parties must be convinced to join, and if this is impossible, control must be left to one of the other parties to let them try to form a government."

 coalition.23.t: "Negotiations with [Monarchist_L] ([?party_pop_elect_array^23|%0])"
 coalition.23.d: "Respected [Root.GetLeader]. Us royalists scoff at the notion that you, a commoner, could ever provide [Root.GetName] with the necessary stability and other splendid advantages that only a absolute monarch can provide. We all know that true supreme executive power can only be properly wielded by royalty in all their holiness. It truly would be a unifying force and a powerful symbol of our greatness, as we march towards full national restoration. Clearly, absolute monarchies, blessed by divine right, outperform all other forms of government in all metrics.\n\nAlright, so we are obviously not going to crown you, so we might keep the outdated and anachronistic republican government for some time, while we royalists in the coalition search for the best candidate for the throne."
 coalition.23.a: "Yeah, sure, whatever"
 coalition.23.b: "You lot are clearly not fit for governing..."
