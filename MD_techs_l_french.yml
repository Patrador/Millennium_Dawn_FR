 body_armor_1980: "Kevlar Vest"
 body_armor_1980_desc: "The first modern body armours before the famous Kevlar vests were mainly made of nylon. Kevlar was first introduced in 1975, and the first vests were adopted to the US Army in the 1980s.\n\nThe first vests offered protection only to the upper torso, and they only protected from shrapnel and pistol rounds."
 body_armor_2000: "Plate Reinforced Vest"
 body_armor_2000_desc: "Even though ceramics have been used in personal protection for long, the first modern ballistic plates were introduced in late 90s and early 2000s. The ballistic plates in these new vests would provide protection from rifle rounds, and shrapnel protection of the vest itself would extend to groinal and neck areas and not just the upper torso."
 body_armor_2010: "Improved Tactical Vest"
 body_armor_2010_desc: "While offering great protection, plate reinforced vests can be cumbersome to the user. This lead to several body armour manufacturers to look for more lighter and tactical designs. While also providing protection, body armour shouldn't limit a soldiers ability to operate on the field. Modern body armours offer integrated solutions where the tactical vests allow personal customisation by the user, making the same vest usable in almost every situation. The protective capabilities are also improved, as modern body armour is capable of even stopping armour piercing bullets."
 body_armor_2030: "Tactical Assault Suite"
 body_armor_2030_desc: "It's no longer necessary to just protect soldiers from bullets and shrapnel. The armour soldiers are wearing also has to provide them assistance in the form of an exoskeleton, environmental protection and augmented reality displays. In addition, instead of using heavy ceramic plates, the protective technology should take advantage of the elastic properties of liquids."

 camouflage: "Early Camouflage"
 camouflage_desc: "While camouflage has been used in the military for centuries, in military uniforms they really started gaining popularity post-Worl War 2. The first camouflage patterns usually consisted of two or three colours almost equally distributed on the uniform."
 camouflage2: "Multi-Scale Camouflage"
 camouflage2_desc: "Multi-Scale camouflage improves the basic camouflage by applying a range of scales to the color patterns of the uniform. This mixes smaller coloured areas on a background colour in a fractal like pattern. This mimicks the colour schemes of nature, making the camouflage more effective in multiple environments and at varying ranges."
 camouflage3: "Digital Camouflage"
 camouflage3_desc: "Digital camouflage is an improvement over the multi-scale camouflage as the created pattern is calculated by computers. Though digital camouflage is often used specifically to refer to a pixelated pattern form, digital camouflage doesn't necessarily equate the pattern to be made of squares."
 camouflage4: "Personal Multispectral Camouflage"
 camouflage4_desc: "Multispectral camouflage refers to camouflage techniques that are used to hide objects from infrared or radar based detection. For individual soldier this has mainly been available in the form ghillie suits, which are impractical in most combat situation. With modern materials, effective infrared shielding coatings and materials can be applied to the battledress of every soldier."
 camouflage5: "Thermoptic Camouflage"
 camouflage5_desc: "With reflective materials, we can not only fool the human eye, but completely hide objects from it. By bending electromagnetic radiation, we can make weapon installation, vehicles, weapons and even soldiers almost invisible to the human eye."

 #Land Doctrines

 LEGACY_DOCTRINES_TITLE: "Legacy Doctrines are Cold War-era doctrines that still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought."
 legacy_doctrines: "Legacy Doctrines"
 legacy_doctrines_desc: "Legacy Doctrines are Cold War-era doctrines that still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought. Though doctrines change over time, the past is still deeply embeded in any armed force."
 modern_blitzkrieg: "Modern Blitzkrieg"
 modern_blitzkrieg_desc: "Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, Germany's Blitzkrieg Doctrine was widely copied by others, becoming a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought - especially in NATO circles. It aims to concentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously maneuver into enemy territory whilst avoiding enemy strong points."
 forward_defense: "Forward Defense"
 forward_defense_desc: "NATO strategists, in countering the threat of Soviet armor overrunning Western Europe, came up with the doctrine of Forward Defense. Pre-planned defensive forces armed with anti-tank and anti-air weapons would starve off the initial push while reserves would be mobilized behind them. The idea was that the initial titanic-sized battles would determine the outcome of the war, and thus the majority of active forces should be placed as close to the front as possible."
 encourage_nco_iniative: "Encourage NCO Initiative"
 encourage_nco_iniative_desc: "Western military thought encouraged initiative among non-commissioned officers (lower-level command), viewing them as the backbone of their armies. With rapidly changing situations, avoiding having to go through the entire chain of command allows an NCO to exploit opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed."
 air_land_battle: "AirLand Battle"
 air_land_battle_desc: "AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, with air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding the enemy front line, taking pressure off the enemy’s main advance. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat front line forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear."
 grand_battleplan: "Grand Battleplan"
 grand_battleplan_desc: "The Grand Battleplan doctrine favors the pre-planning of each stage of combat extensively, holding the view that the side with the best planning would prevail. When done correctly, it can be very powerful, as troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. While good planning avoids logistical problems, it is slow work, redicing initiative and having no real flexibility in the face of a fluid front line."
 rigid_hierarchy: "Rigid Hierarchy"
 rigid_hierarchy_desc: "With the legitimate fear that one’s own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be done out of political loyality instead of competance. Large, live-fire excersises would generally not be held. Furthermore, desicion-making would be centralized, making it slow and inflexible in the face of evolving threats."

Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units in order to break the enemy tactical zone. At the same time, highly mobile armored and mechanized forces would be held in reserve, advancing into the front once gaps are created. This is distinct from Blitzkreig, which focuses on single weak-points instead of multiple points of contact."

 armoured_counterpunch: "Armoured Counterpunch"
 armoured_counterpunch_desc: "Building upon Defense in Depth, this strategy is about deploying significant armored forces at advantageous times in order to cut off deep echelon advances, achieving an decisive victory. However, such concentrations are vulnerable to enemy airpower."

 TITLE_GUERILLA: "Guerilla Warfare"
 GUERILLA_WARFARE_TITLE: "By denying a superior enemy desisive battle and instead attacking their support structure, they will be forced to disperse into smaller units we can catch by surprise.

 Rhizome_Manoeuver_desc: "An tactic for urban areas, the Rhizome Manoeuver is essentially "walking through walls", treating the urban enviroment not as a grid of streets, but as a flexible, almost liquid medium, forever in flux. This allows for unobserved movement and unexpected attacks. It can further be enchanced by the unprecedented mobility of having special units trained in parkour."
 Light_Infantry_Focus: "Light Infantry Focus"
