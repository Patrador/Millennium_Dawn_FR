 election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."

 election.4.d:1 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.4.a:0 "Rather them than the communists!"
 election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."

Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies.

The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler.

 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

 election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."

 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 election.17.a:0 "Splitters!"
 political.1.t:0 "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate.

 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

[Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either.

Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state.

Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public.

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

Due to its historical and artistic treasures, many had never thought the ancient city would be the target of such indiscriminate destruction. With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack.

France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state.

The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack.

Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected.

Likewise, Xiamen Airlines cancelled all scheduled flights.\n\nDespite becoming a weaker storm upon its landfall in China as opposed to its landfall on Taiwan, Bilis caused more fatalities and accrued a greater damage cost in China. Economic losses in China totaled US$534 million, with most of the losses occurring in Fujian Province. A total of 57 people were killed, though an additional 1,077 people were either wounded or went missing. Due to felled trees, a railway line from Fuzhou to Mawei blocked rail service.

 #Yemeni Events

 Yemen.4.t:0 "The War in Yemen has Ended"
 Yemen.4.d:0 "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missiles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region with the help of the Saudi coalition and it's campaign, Restoring Hope, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being rebuilt."
 Yemen.4.d2:0 "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibility of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of rebuilding the country. The Saudi coalition has withdrawn from the region, and has rendered Operation Restoring Hope, a complete and utter failure."
 Yemen.4.d3:0 "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The Saudi coalition and Operation Restoring Hope has been a complete failure, and it's incompetence has failed to predict it's own defeat to an enemy it never new was this serious. The Jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realize what this new caliphate can do."

 Saleh.1.d:0 "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was concieved. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a:0 "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b:0 "Get President Saleh on the phone..."

 Saleh.2.t:0 "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b:0 "It couldn't hurt..."

 Saleh.3.t:0 "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d:0 "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a:0 "Well then, gather the coalition."
 Saleh.3.b:0 "This probably isn't a good idea..."

 Saleh.5.t:0 "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d:0 "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publically declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a:0 "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b:0 "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."

 Saleh.6.t:0 "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d:0 "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a:0 "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b:0 "Let him go..."

 Saleh.7.t:0 "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d:0 "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot forsee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a:0 "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it"
 Saleh.7.b:0 "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together"

 Saleh.8.t:0 "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d:0 "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a:0 "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b:0 "Forget it..."

 Saleh.9.t:0 "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a:0 "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b:0 "Ali, stop this immediately, or else"
 Saleh.9.c:0 "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"

 HOU_Saleh.1:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3:0 "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 HOU_Saleh.4:0 "Ali is disappointed."
 HOU_Saleh.5:0 "Ali will be contacted once more."
 HOU_Saleh.6:0 "Ali visibly recoils, and exits the room."
 HOU_Saleh.7:0 "Ali will be contacted again, but let this be the final warning to him that if he remains aligned with our enemy, he too will be treated as an enemy."

 Saleh.10.t:0 "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d:0 "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a:0 "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b:0 "This is pointless..."

 Saleh.11.t:0 "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d:0 "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a:0 "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"

 Saleh.12.t:0 "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d:0 "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
 Saleh.12.a:0 "Good work boys."
 Saleh.12.b:0 "This is troubling..."
 Saleh.12.c:0 "Interesting."

 Saleh.13.t:0 "Saleh Renews GPC-Houthi Alliance"
 Saleh.13.d:0 "The leader of the General People's Congress, a long-time Houthi ally, though not on the greatest of terms, has declared a renewal of the once divided alliance. Ali Abdullah Saleh publically announced a new chapter in Yemen's future, a chapter in which the GPC and Houthis will work together to restore the ruined nation. Saleh gave one condition, and that was that the Houthi leadership formalizes the Supreme Political Council, an interim government put in place in the time of war, and split the rulership between the two alliances, as was originally planned."
 Saleh.13.a:0 "Is this good? I can't tell."
 Saleh.13.b:0 "Damn!"

 Saleh.14.t:0 "The Coalition Gathers"
 Saleh.14.d:0 "The Houthi leadership opposing the democratic, Hadi-led government in Yemen, has shown that they are willing to come to the table and talk about the humanitarian situation currently ongoing in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition operating in Yemen, has invited all of it's members to a diplomatic summit being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The special guests will be Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi himself, along with his associate, Ali Abdullah Saleh."
 Saleh.14.a:0 "We must attend."
 Saleh.14.b:0 "Sorry, we don't have time for this."
 Saleh.14.c:0 "We would be honoured to host this summit."

 Saleh.15.t:0 "The Summit Commences"
 Saleh.15.d:0 "Those that chose to attend that summit take their seats, and await the beginning of the discussion. The Houthis have mentioned that they are not coming into this discussion with the intent to just surrender, so we must sway them to see the conflict from an outsider's shoes. This war in Yemen has been one of the greatest humanitarian crises in recent memory, and it would benefit all parties for the war to be put to a halt as soon as possible. To make this quick, let us share our demands..."
 Saleh.15.a:0 "Surrender and return all territories to Yemen's rightful government."
 Saleh.15.b:0 "Cease the conflict immediately, and both states shall remain independent."
 Saleh.15.c:0 "All Houthi claimed land shall be declared an Arabian state."

 Saleh.16.t:0 "The Coalition Demands Surrender"
 Saleh.16.d:0 "We were invited to this summit in Abu Dhabi to discuss a potential end to the war we have been fighting for years now, and we have come to the realization that this was all a waste of time. We were immediately greeted by an absurd demand as soon as the summit had started, that demand being our full surrender. But, as long as the war still rages, people will continue to die and cities will continue to be destroyed. Ending the war may be for the better, but it would mean capitulating to our sworn enemies."
 Saleh.16.a:0 "This war must end, so we must oblige."
 Saleh.16.b:0 "Ridiculous! This discussion ends now!"

 Saleh.17.t:0 "The Coalition Demands both States Remain Independent"

Even though the worst violence is behind them, the government will still have to work hard to remove all sectarian violence from the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.SEL.d:0 "The Seleka coalition in Central Africa has secured control of the country.\n\nThe origins of the group is in 2003, when it was formed to combat Michael Bozize's coup. After the Seleka leader Michel Djotodia was made president in 2013, the group was officially disbanded. This caused the ex-fighters to go on a reign of terror in the country, igniting the civil war.\n\nDespite being predominantly Muslim (thus representing only a tenth of the population), the group still has managed to once again gain control of the country. This will most likely create another wave of terror on the predominantly Christian population of the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.BAL.d:0 "The Anti-Balaka allince in Central Africa has gained control of the country.\n\nWhat started as a Christian militia to protect from highwaymen in the 90s, turned into an official self-protection group in 2009. The group's main purpose became to fight against the Seleka militias, who were predominantly Muslim. Like their enemies, they quickly adopted violent tactics, force converting, burning and mass executing Muslims in the country.\n\nThe group is now in full control of the country, and future prospects for the small Muslim minority are looking bleak."

This greatly upset the non-secular leadership of Al-Shabaab.\n\nDespite being driven to near defeat in 2017, the Islamist group managed to bounce back and gather support from various smaller Islamist and tribal factions, many of which were displeased with the Western-backed secular government.

After a religious conflict between a Christian shop owner and a Muslim customer, the Muslim community of the village was outraged into a frenzy and began looting and pillaging Christian shops and storefronts, mainly in the outskirts of the city in el-Kosheh village, a good distance away from the city of Kosheh.\n\nThis massacre was one of the largest in Egypt's history and calls the efficiency of our majority-Muslim government into action.

The United States has long abandoned her doctrine of freedom and liberty in favor of a doctrine of oil and money.\n\nAfrica needs to stand together and unite under the flag of one common military alliance to resist both American and Russian, both Chinese and Indian ambitions to form military blocs.\n\nWe shall send invitations to all eligible African Union members.

 ethiopia.8.d:0 "After World War II, the railway began a long period of decline. Traffic on the railway dropped in half from 1953 to 1957, as road transport began to compete for cargo. The Ogaden War of 1977–1978 dealt a further blow to the railway, as Somali troops invaded us and captured the railway as far as Dire Dawa. Portions of the railway were blown up in the war, and railway operations were again cut in half. After the war ended, the railway continued to decline from a lack of maintenance and attacks from rebels such as the Ogaden Liberation Front.\n\nBoth the lack of maintenance and an ambitious road construction program made rail transport increasingly non-competitive. In January 1985, the Awash rail disaster killed 429 passengers when their train derailed on the Awash River Bridge and fell into the gorge below. Railway service finally ended this year between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, but trains continued to run between Dire Dawa and Djibouti. The tracks between Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa fell into total disrepair, and many of the rails were stolen and sold for scrap."

 european_union.10.d3:0 "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of.

After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation.

 #Finland
 Finland.1.t:0 "Conscription Reform"
 Finland.1.d:0 "The Finnish military has held strong onto its conscription laws even after the main threat to Finnish sovereignity, the Soviet Union, stopped to exist. Nowadays, Finnish conscription laws seems archaic, with men and women not being treated equally under who gets to serve or not to serve in civilian or military service at how long or at what punishment when refusing to serve.\n\nSome argue that conscription should be abolished and that both the money and the freed up workforce could then profit the civilian economy. More conservative thinkers point to the Russian Federation as 'the Soviet Union but less red', with a possible Russian willingness to re-establish global ambition posing a very real threat to Finnish independence."

 Finland.5.t:0 "Foreign Policy Doctrine"
 Finland.5.d:0 "Finland has always been in a precarious spot on the world map, trapped between Russia on one side and nations that want to stay away from Russia on the other.

 Finland.5.b:0 "The government needs to hire additional diplomats."
 Finland.6.t:0 "Military Policy"

 Finland.7.t:0 "The Finnish Monarchy"
 Finland.7.d:0 "Frederik Kaarle I is the Finnish name of Friedrich Karl, the German prince from Hesse-Kassel that almost became King of Finland in 1918. His descendants were rather reluctant to step forward when our government published plans to establish a German monarchy friendly to the imperial government in Berlin - primarily because of how unpopular the idea is in the Finnish public.\n\nFinally, Donatus Philipp Umberto, the great-grandson of Friedrich Karl but also a great-grandson of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, has stepped forward and presented himself as an option to the Finnish government.\n\nHe will do fine.

In exchange for the restoration of the 1938 border between Finland and the then Russian Republic inside the USSR, Finland offers to join the CSTO military alliance.\n\nSuch an offer is an insult to Russian nationalism, but a military prospect that might be worth considering.

 Finland.8.b:0 "We laugh in their face."
 Finland.9.t:0 "Finland offers Mutual Defensive Agreement"

While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparantly belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages.

The supporters of the government formed a new faction, the National Salvation Government, sparking a new civil war. In 2015, the UN brokered a truce between the two factions, forming a new joint-government called the Government of National Accord. However, only a year later the peace was shattered, plunging the country into a three-way civil war.\n\nIt seems that the internationally backed Government of National Accord has managed to overcome the rebellious factions and unite the country, despite lacking the backing of the Libyan military. Being recognized by the EU and much of the Western world, this is a vast shift of balance in the region."

The Taiwanese wished for peace, but they were also protesting the deployment of missiles by the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China aimed at Taiwan, their island neighbor. Some of the symbolism of the demonstration, particularly at the point in the event where participants 'turn away from China' veered clearly toward support of Taiwanese independence, and hence was not attended by members of the Pan-Blue Coalition who countered the demonstration with an island-wide rally of their own days later."

In addition to the closure of businesses, flights to and from the island were rescheduled, and a typhoon relief center was established. Due to the threat of landslides, a landslide warning was issued for Taiwan. Though the storm had not yet made landfall, one person was killed in Taipei on August 22 after they were buried by a landslide triggered by the impending typhoon; this accounted for the first fatality caused by Bilis. Along with flight rescheduling, numerous airports were closed, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange was set to close on August 23. Meanwhile, hospitals extended service times in anticipation for patient admittance. Taiwanese coast guard members regulated fishing activity due to the threat of deadly wave action. The Port of Kaohsiung was closed throughout the duration of the storm. Due to the heightened demand for vegetables in the lead-up to the storm, the cost of such foods increased by 20 to 30 percent.\n\nBilis was a highly destructive tropical cyclone for Taiwan. Damage to the island's agricultural, fishing, and forestry industries amounted to US$133.5 million. The typhoon caused 14 fatalities and injured an additional 80 people. Power outages adversely impacted approximately 600,000 households, and 400 homes across Taiwan were destroyed. Several hundred thousand families experienced water shortage following the storm. In Cheng-Kung, a weather station recorded a 281 km/h wind gust, which broke the station's anemometer. A single landslide in the town of Jenai buried nine farmers. Tens of thousands of people were displaced during the storm, and moved into evacuation shelters set up by the government. In eastern Hualien County, 250 houses succumbed to strong winds. The winds also felled trees and blew light vehicles around, blocking roads. Heavy rainfall associated with Bilis flooded roughly 40,000 ha of orchards and rice paddies. Following Bilis' passage of Taiwan, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the island, exacerbating the already worsened conditions."

This has the potential to put an end to more than half a century of Kuomintang rule on Taiwan, since the KMT voters split in half.\n\nThough more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, the outspoken former Taiwan Governor James Soong failed to gain the Kuomintang's nomination. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. The Kuomintang responded by expelling Soong and 21 of his allies. They sued Soong for theft, alleging that as party Secretary-General, he stole millions of Taiwan dollars in cash intended for the family of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and hid the money in the Chunghsing Bills Finance Co. Soong defended himself by saying he was acting under Lee's direction, but his story was largely unpersuasive. Initially holding a commanding lead in the polls, Soong lost by just over 300,000 votes, and the financial scandal that tarnished his image as a clean politician will likely led to his failure.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party run former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian for president. Having run for the 1996 election on a radical independence platform and lost by a landslide, the DPP in May 1999 moderated its stance by issuing the "Resolution on the Future of Taiwan." The resolution accepted the status quo and promoted the moderate view that Taiwan was already independent, so any formal declaration would not be urgently necessary, if at all. Also included was the pledge that any change in Taiwan's international status will have to be done through a referendum, thus alleviating the fear that, if elected, a DPP government would unilaterally declare independence without popular approval. The Chen-Lu ticket also promises to be more aggressive in fighting black gold, to provide more funding for social services, and to be more environmentally friendly, such as opposition to nuclear power."

 United_Kingdom.1.d:0 "The Falkland Islands have been a point of contention between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina for decades, with Argentina formally laying claim to the island archipelago (as well as neighboring South Georgia) in 1833.\n\nThe Falklands were first colonized by France in 1764 with a settlement on the eastern island, which was joined by a British settlement on the western one in 1766. However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Mavlinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta. There is really no reason why they should be Argentinian, but having a country that owes Britain a favor could be good in the long run..."

 switzerland_news.1.t:0 "Switzerland joins the UN"
 switzerland_news.1.d:0 "Originally, the Swiss government had refused to join the United Nations after the end of the Second World War, pointing to the country's continued dedication to its own neutrality - which is especially weird considering the UN's main seat in Europe is the UNOG, the United Nations Office in Geneva.\n\nNow, after a public referendum on the matter, the Swiss government has announced that the country would move forward to abandon its post as a spectator and would now join the organization as a full member."

 switzerland_news.2.t:0 "The End of Swiss Neutrality"
 switzerland_news.2.d:0 "Switzerland's commitment to international neutrality and non-alignment in times of both peace and war goes back to the year 1516, when the Swiss Confederacy stopped its policy of expansion after a defeat at French hands. Swiss secession from the Holy Roman Empire in 1648 helped the country further that stance. The final step was in 1815, when all major powers acknowledged and guaranteed Swiss neutrality in the post-Napoleonic Congress of Vienna.\n\nThis era of Swiss history is now over. The president of the federal council, [SWI.GetLeader], has announced that Switzerland would no longer continue to honor its oaths of old and has formally absolved the major powers previously guaranteeing its independence off their duty to do so."

 switzerland_news.4.d:0 "In a move creating a political union that is very close to a military faction (but of course officially not a military faction), the Swiss defensive ministry has gotten parliamentary support for the creation of a 'Swiss Protection League' (which has, as is custom in Switzerland, four different official names in the various languages of the country).\n\nThis seems to be the next big step in further armed 'neutrality' of Switzerland."
 switzerland_news.4.o1:0 "Armed Neutrality indeed."
 switzerland_news.5.t:0 "The Alpine Republic"
 switzerland_news.5.d:0 "The Swiss government has sent requests to the governments of Liechtenstein and Austria to approve of legislation to join the Swiss Confederation in the form of 20 new cantons.\nAt the same time, Switzerland has also officially changed its name to 'The Republic of the Alps' or 'Alpine Republic' for short.\n\nVaduz and Vienna are yet to respond, but chances for unification seem surprisingly good. Liechtenstein has been guaranteed the right to preserve its monarch as permanent head of the canton even in the Republican form of government and Austria has been guaranteed 49% of the seats in the new parliament, with 45% going to the four national communities of Switzerland and 6% to Liechtenstein."

All of those entities have further already confirmed plans to be absorbed into the respective linguistic motherland.\n\nThis marks the end of Swiss Independence. The country has existed without interruption since the legendary Rütlischwur of 1307."
