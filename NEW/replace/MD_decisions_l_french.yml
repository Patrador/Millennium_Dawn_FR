 ### Help events ###
 help_events.0.t:0 "Economics"
 help_events.0.d:0 "In MD4, your factories represent the GDP of your country. This is the total amount of value of all goods produced in your country.\n\nPart of your factories are used up by your government to fund the basic functions of the government. This is called Tax Cost (Consumer Goods in the base game). The higher your Tax Cost, the less factories you have available for investing in your economy (ie. constructing new factories)."
 help_events.0.a:0 "To Economic Indicators"
 help_events.1.t:0 "Economic Indicators"
 help_events.1.d:0 "Your economic indicators can be found on the politics screen. The richness of your country is measured by your GDP/C (GDP per capita). The higher the value, the richer your population is. Increasing your GDP/C will grant you more building slots in your states, and give you access to more research slots (see 'Research' help). You can increase your GDP/C by filling your building slots. Once you have no more empty slots, you will be able to advance to the next GDP/C level, which will give you more slots, which you fill and so forth.\n\nYour Economic Cycle dictates the speed at which your economy is growing (construction speed). Having a fast growing economy will also make your government more popular. Economic Cycles can be affected by events, and it can be increased by spending Political Power."
 help_events.1.a:0 "To Government Budget"
 help_events.2.t:0 "Government Budget"
 help_events.2.d:0 "Your Government Budget can be found on the politics screen as well. Your budget dictates how much your government spends on various governmental functions, such as defence. Spending more will give you various bonuses but will increase your Tax Cost. This will then make it harder for you to expand your economy. You can offset some of this spending by loaning money by having a negative budget balance.\n\nLoaning money will slowly increase your national debt, which will increase your Tax Cost in the long run as you have to pay interest. You can also have a positive budget balance, which will slowly pay off your debt and increase your monetary reserves. On the long run, this will give you reduced Tax Cost since you can use some of your reserves to fund your budget."

 help_events.3.t:0 "Units"
 help_events.3.d:0 "In MD4, all of your units start at 0 strength. This done so that we can then add correct real life equipment to units through the stockpile. Due to this, you should avoid training new units for the first week or so in order not to rob equipment from your existing units. Don't be scared by the large number of equipment there are available. Most basic infantry units can be deployed with just small arms. Obviously, not having AA or AT equipment will impact your units' ability to fight against aircraft or armoured vehicles. When playing as smaller countries, you'll have to rotate your production lines to get all the equipment you need.\n\nThe most effective way of gaining more manpower is by increasing your military spending."
