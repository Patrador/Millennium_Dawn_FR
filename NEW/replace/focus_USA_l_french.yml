#Army
 USA_united_states_army:0 "The US Army"
 USA_united_states_army_desc:0 "The US Army, established even before independence, is the greatest and most powerful military force in the world, even as we've allowed it to lapse since the end of the Cold War. No matter how we wish to enter this new century, we must strengthen the Army's position and underline its significance, or we'll finally be left behind."
 USA_support_small_arms_companies:0 "Support Small Arms Companies"
 USA_support_small_arms_companies_desc:0 "The free access of each American citizen to firearms is important. By removing some burdensome taxes from small arms companies and sellers, we can enable our civilian population to arm themselves much more effectively."
 USA_develop_artillery_models:0 "Modern Artillery Platforms"
 USA_develop_artillery_models_desc:0 "Tanks are shiny, and infantry gets all the credit, but the amount of work done by artillery - the unsung hero of the armed forces - should not be underestimated. We need to work on our artillery platforms."
 USA_infantry_equipment_models_1:0 "Advanced Combat Rifle Program"
 USA_infantry_equipment_models_1_desc:0 "To stay ahead of the game and ensure we have the most technologically advanced infantry weapons on the planet, we should invest in our small arms manufacturers."

 USA_strengthen_national_morale_desc:0 "By reminding the American public of their military heritage, we will revive the people's patriotic fervor!"
 USA_army_doctrine_1:0 "Lessons of the Cold War"
 USA_army_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Our military academies produce the most intelligent and clever military minds on Earth. We can put this resource to good use and develop better strategies to engage our enemies with."
 USA_mbt_models:0 "TUSK Program"
 USA_mbt_models_desc:0 "The ultimate expression of land-based firepower and symbol of shock and awe, we must prioritize advanced battle tank development to keep our edge on the battlefield."
 USA_small_arms_production_focus:0 "Small Arms Production Focus"
 USA_small_arms_production_focus_desc:0 "We can ramp up our firearm production even further to better arm our populace and military."
 USA_recruitment_tactics:0 "Recruitment Tactics"
 USA_recruitment_tactics_desc:0 "We can employ carefully tailor propaganda to encourage even stronger recruitment trends and fill up our ranks with the fresh young faces we need."
 USA_army_doctrine_2:0 "Reform the National Training Center"
 USA_army_doctrine_2_desc:0 "The United States military has historically been one of the world's largest and most effective fighting forces. However, some of our doctrines are starting to show their age. We can do better, and, by promoting innovative thought among the brass, we will."
 USA_engineer_tanks:0 "Engineer Tanks"
 USA_engineer_tanks_desc:0 "Though often overlooked, engineering vehicles fulfill many vital support functions on and off the battlefield. Let's invest some effort into giving the army the support vehicles they need."
 USA_infantry_equipment_models_2:0 "Objective Individual Combat Weapon Program"
 USA_infantry_equipment_models_2_desc:0 "Our previous efforts towards the development of cutting-edge infantry weapons provided massive returns. We should do it again and initiate the OICW project."
 USA_uncle_sam_needs_you:0 "Uncle Sam Needs You"
 USA_uncle_sam_needs_you_desc:0 "Now that America is under active attack by a hostile and dangerous force, we need to revive our greatest national icons in order to rally the population and defend ourselves."
 USA_support_vehicle_models:0 "Infantry Support Vehicles"
 USA_support_vehicle_models_desc:0 "Infantry are soft and not the most durable on their own. A few Bradleys and the like should improve their likelihood of staying alive to fight another day."
 USA_army_doctrine_3:0 "Twenty-First Century Army"
 USA_army_doctrine_3_desc:0 "We can't afford to sit back on our laurels! We must continue to innovate and devise ever better tactics for our brave soldiers to employ on the battlefield. With our army at the forefront, nothing will be impossible for us."
 #Navy
 USA_united_states_navy:0 "The US Navy"
 USA_united_states_navy_desc:0 "The United States Navy is the most expensive military force in the world; its budget, by itself, is larger than that of any other entire military on Earth, and for good reason! The Army may be our backbone, but the Navy is our armor and shield; after all, most of the world is on the other side of an ocean from us. Given how important it is, it couldn't hurt to make the Navy stronger."
 USA_destroyer_models_1:0 "Update the Destroyer Fleet"
 USA_destroyer_models_1_desc:0 "Although the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are old, they still pack a good punch with their multi-mission design and guided missile capacity. We can keep the old ones around for a long time to come, but it's probably time to start looking to the next generation of destroyers."
 USA_small_ship_models_1:0 "Small Ship Initative"
 USA_small_ship_models_1_desc:0 "The United States, like any other navy, does not function on capital ships like its great aircraft carriers alone. It requires smaller vessels to patrol coastal waters and minesweepers to keep the seas open and free. We must not forget to keep our less glamorous but vital littoral forces at the cutting edge."
 USA_destroyer_models_2:0 "Advanced Destroyer Models"
 USA_destroyer_models_2_desc:0 "Our Cold War-legacy vessels are very much showing their age, and even our newer ones won't be at the forefront of naval technology forever. We must look further still into the future to create a truly new destroyer for a new century."
 USA_small_ship_models_2:0 "Littoral Combat Ships"
 USA_small_ship_models_2_desc:0 "While we've made great strides in improving our support ships, there's still plenty of room for progress. The Littoral Combat Ship and its potential successors represent a huge leap forward in capability for our smaller ships - though with our newest proposals, "smaller" is something of a relative term."
 USA_submarine_models_1:0 "Beyond the Los Angeles Class"
 USA_submarine_models_1_desc:0 "Our surface fleet is important, but we must not forget the Silent Service - our brave submariners. They deserve the best boats we can give them, but our current submarines are starting to reach the end of their useful service lives."
 USA_carrier_models_1:0 "New Carrier Designs"
 USA_carrier_models_1_desc:0 "Our huge Nimitz-class carriers may be the envy of the world, but that attention has spurred our potential rivals to begin carrier programs of their own. We can't afford to sit still while other nations catch up. Let us invest strongly in newer and better flagships for our great Navy."
 USA_submarine_focus:0 "Reform the Silent Service"
 USA_submarine_focus_desc:0 "New classes of submarines can only get us so far - now we must put in the time to figure out how to use them properly in the modern era."
 USA_naval_doctrine_1:0 "Naval Doctrine Reform"
 USA_naval_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Our current strategy of just having more ships than we know what to do with seems somewhat problembatic. Perhaps we might also want to work on some new tactics?"
 USA_submarine_models_2:0 "New Submarines for a New Navy"
 USA_submarine_models_2_desc:0 "Further submarine improvements are needed to give the Silent Service the tools they need to dominate the seas."
 USA_carrier_models_2:0 "The Modern Floating Airfield"
 USA_carrier_models_2_desc:0 "We must continually update our carrier fleet to keep ahead of our rivals, rather than assuming a single step forward will be enough to assure our naval dominance."
 USA_naval_doctrine_2:0 "Naval War College Wargames"
 USA_naval_doctrine_2_desc:0 "War has changed, and so must our methods of waging it on the seas. We should build on what we have already accomplished, and put our brightest theoreticians to work."
 USA_naval_doctrine_3:0 "Twenty-First Century Navy"
 USA_naval_doctrine_3_desc:0 "A true twenty-first century navy requires true twenty-first century tactics; with one last push, our officers can finally wield a tactical repertoire worthy of the mighty ships they command."
 #Air Force
 USA_united_states_air_force:0 "The US Air Force"
 USA_united_states_air_force_desc:0 "In this modern battlefield, our air force will be one of the most significant branches in the event of a war."
 USA_united_states_marine_corps:0 "The US Marine Corps"
 USA_united_states_marine_corps_desc:0 "The Marine Corps is technically the largest special operations force in the world. This is not enough. We should invest even more in it than we currently do!"
 USA_air_force_production:0 "Expand the Aerospace Industry"
 USA_air_force_production_desc:0 "By investing more money into our aircraft manufacturers, we can increase production to unheard-of levels."
 USA_east_coast_air_bases:0 "East Coast Air Bases"
 USA_east_coast_air_bases_desc:0 "An air force is no good if it lacks the reach to even cover its own home territory, and at the moment, the Eastern Seaboard is looking awfully sparsely defended. We can plan out entire new airfields and take advantage of existing civilian airport infrastructure along the coast to close this hole in our defenses."
 USA_strengthen_the_airborne_infantry:0 "Strengthen the Airborne Infantry"
 USA_strengthen_the_airborne_infantry_desc:0 "The strategic mobility of paratroopers could very well be the deciding factor in a campaign, so we must ensure ours are ready for anything."
 USA_early_fighter_models:0 "Advanced Tactical Fighter Program"
 USA_early_fighter_models_desc:0 "Battlefield air superiority has been vital since the days of the First World War. It's time we updated the Air Force to keep pace with our potential enemies."
 USA_early_bomber_models:0 "Modernize the Bomber Fleet"
 USA_early_bomber_models_desc:0 "Heavy surface attack aircraft are always important in warfare, but ours are growing long in the tooth. We should work towards the development more modern models."
 USA_west_coast_air_bases:0 "West Coast Air Bases"
 USA_west_coast_air_bases_desc:0 "Now that the East Coast has been secured, we should shore up the West Coast as well."
 USA_ucav_models_1:0 "Drone Warfare"
 USA_ucav_models_1_desc:0 "Drones provide a way to strike hard-to-reach targets and provide long-duration close air support without risking our own pilots' lives. We should invest more money into this field."
 USA_advanced_fighter_models:0 "DARPA Aerospace Projects"
 USA_advanced_fighter_models_desc:0 "We have the capability to pave the way towards the future in fighter technology, so let us do so."
 USA_advanced_bomber_models:0 "Air Force Global Strike Command"
 USA_advanced_bomber_models_desc:0 "Now that we have perfected the previous bomber models, we can move onto even more advanced designs."
 USA_air_doctrine_1:0 "RED FLAG Alaska"
 USA_air_doctrine_1_desc:0 "A technologically advanced air force is useless without a doctrine which uses it intelligently. To start, we can expand our existing RED FLAG training exercises to more locations and more iterations."
 USA_ucav_models_2:0 "Advanced UCAV Models"
 USA_ucav_models_2_desc:0 "We can only stand to benefit from improving our drones yet again."
 USA_air_doctrine_2:0 "Interservice Air Combat Training"
 USA_air_doctrine_2_desc:0 "A new world requires new strategies. Let us assign our finest minds across all services to furthering the art of aerial warfare."
 USA_air_doctrine_3:0 "Twenty-First Century Air Force"
 USA_air_doctrine_3_desc:0 "We have invested a great amount of funds, time, and thought into our air force, but in the end, it was worth it. We shall take the world by storm, and the Air Force will lead the way!"
 USA_continue_space_efforts:0 "Revitalize the Space Program"
 USA_continue_space_efforts_desc:0 "Nearly 60 years ago, NASA launched Apollo 11, successfully landing the first human on the Moon, winning the Space Race. Afterward, we Americans sank into complacency, as space lost its wonder. No more! It is time to renew our efforts and push back the final frontier."
 USA_finance_nasa:0 "Finance NASA"
 USA_finance_nasa_desc:0 "NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, got us to the Moon, sent satellites into orbit, blasted probes into the outer solar system and deep space, and landed rovers on Mars. All it lacks is major funding from the government, with which we could finally realize our dreams of space exploration."
 USA_finance_private_space_ventures:0 "Finance Private Space Ventures"
 USA_finance_private_space_ventures_desc:0 "Private companies, like SpaceX, have shown a tremendous ability to lower the costs and increase the efficiency of space travel. The future of space is private."
 USA_asteroid_mining:0 "Asteroid Mining"
 USA_asteroid_mining_desc:0 "Asteroids contain many materials rare or hard to extract here on Earth, like platinum, gold, iridum, and the elusive rare earth metals - something we desperately lack domestically. It does take a massive effort to tow an asteroid into orbit around Earth, but the rewards will be beyond our wildest dreams."
 USA_establishment_of_the_space_force:0 "Establishment of the Space Force"
 USA_establishment_of_the_space_force_desc:0 "Why didn't we call it the Space Marines? That would've been a much better name."
 USA_launch_pad_in_brazil:0 "Launch Pad in Brazil"
 USA_launch_pad_in_brazil_desc:0 "Rockets, believe it or not, need to get to space in order to do anything useful. Launching rockets from the equator is much better than launching from Florida, as we can use the additional inertia from the Earth's rotation to make getting into orbit much easier. An opportunity has recently opened up in Brazil to do exactly that..."
 USA_weaponized_space:0 "Militarize Space"
 USA_weaponized_space_desc:0 "Satellites with lasers... sounds great! What could go wrong?"
 USA_space_marines:0 "Space Marines"
 USA_space_marines_desc:0 "Service guarantees citizenship!"
 USA_mission_to_mars:0 "Mission to Mars"
 USA_mission_to_mars_desc:0 "Landing a human on Mars has been the dream of space enthusiasts for years, if not decades. Mars is now Priority Number One."
 USA_revisit_the_moon:0 "Revisit the Moon"
 USA_revisit_the_moon_desc:0 "The last time man set foot upon the Moon was back in 1972. Why not put a new one there? What is stopping us?"
 USA_lunar_outpost:0 "Lunar Outpost"
 USA_lunar_outpost_desc:0 "It is currently well within the realm of possibility to put an outpost on the Moon. That said, setting up and maintaining a lunar base will still be the greatest technical challenge the world has ever faced. Then again... that didn't stop the first lunar landing, did it?"

 #Economy
 USA_the_american_economy:0 "The American Economy"
 USA_the_american_economy_desc:0 "Nominally speaking, our economy is the largest in the world, and we remain an economic force to be reckoned with. Our financial advisors are divided between those favoring continued regulations and those claiming the time is right to loosen the grip on the economy."
 USA_deregulation:0 "Revitalized Industry"
 USA_deregulation_desc:0 "The United States has been a country of incredible economic growth in the past one hundred years. It emerged from World War II as the world's largest economy. "
 USA_regulation:0 "Regulated Markets"
 USA_regulation_desc:0 "The neoclassical belief in "voodoo economics" is dangerous. While the free market is important, it must be tempered by federal oversight lest it get enough rope to hang itself."
 USA_aluminium_and_steel_production:0 "Structural Metals Production"
 USA_aluminium_and_steel_production_desc:0 "We boast the fourth-largest steel and sixth-largest aluminum industry in the world, but we can do even better. Bauxite is readily available for exploitation in both Arkansas and Alabama, if we so desire."
 USA_reduce_market_regulations:0 "Unleash the Free Market"
 USA_reduce_market_regulations_desc:0 "The free market is a cornerstone of the American model, and should remain that way. The economy thrives when it is led by the invisible hand of the market, rather than the clenched fist of the government."
 USA_create_jobs_on_the_west_coast:0 "Create Jobs on the West Coast"
 USA_create_jobs_on_the_west_coast_desc:0 "Even though the West Coast is only home to less than 20% of our citizens, it has seen an enormous growth, with cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle becoming core metropolitan areas. There's still room for growth, however, and supporting Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and other big industries and businesses will easily create a large number of new jobs."
 USA_strengthen_the_federal_reserve:0 "Strengthen the Federal Reserve"
 USA_strengthen_the_federal_reserve_desc:0 "The Fed is our central banking system, and it is paramount that we protect and strengthen it to ensure that the economy continues to flourish. A strong Federal Reserve is crucial to a strong federal government."
 USA_oil_and_rubber_production:0 "Invest in the Petrochemical Sector"
 USA_oil_and_rubber_production_desc:0 "We have large financial interests riding on the oil industry, and any funding invested in R&D there will inevitably improve overall resource extraction. As an added bonus, it may support our rubber production as well. Further, from these few states we can boost our percentage of the worlds production of crude oil. Currently we only produce 12%."
 USA_industrial_oversight_committee:0 "Industrial Oversight Committee"
 USA_industrial_oversight_committee_desc:0 "We need to find new and effective ways of conducting regulatory services if we don't want our extensive government regulation to completely smother industrial growth. A good first move would be to establish a committee tasked with monitoring the industry at large."
 USA_build_additional_refineries:0 "Subsidize Biofuel Pioneers"
 USA_build_additional_refineries_desc:0 "The lack of new-found oil reserves around the country should entice us to start investigating other methods of fuel production. Biofuel and ehtanol may be right up our alley if we are looking to expand our production of important oil substitutes."
 USA_corporatist_legislation:0 "Business-Friendly Legislation"
 USA_corporatist_legislation_desc:0 "The corporations in the United States are powerful entities. It may be in our interest to suggest they enter the policital scene and 'help' us restructure the legislature."
 USA_create_jobs_on_the_east_coast:0 "Create Jobs on the East Coast"
 USA_create_jobs_on_the_east_coast_desc:0 "The Eastern Seaboard sports a number of large cities, such as the Boston-New York-Baltimore-DC megalopolis, along with major Southern cities like Charleston and Raleigh. A regulatory overhaul could go a long way toward incentivizing new industrial investments in the region."
 USA_military_production_increase:0 "Planned Military-Industrial Production"
 USA_military_production_increase_desc:0 "The Industrial Oversight Committee has streamlined our regulatory bodies and greatly improved industrial effectiveness. Perhaps it's time to further centralize regulatory oversight and turn it into actual control mechanisms. This will enable greater governmental say in matters of industry."
 USA_military_production_centralization_reform:0 "Defense Contractor Investment"
 USA_military_production_centralization_reform_desc:0 "There is much room for expansion in the far Northeast. Perhaps we could incentivize one of the big contractors to open up a new plant or two there and expand the local economy."
 USA_expand_the_monetary_control_act:0 "Expand the Monetary Control Act"
 USA_expand_the_monetary_control_act_desc:0 "The Monetary Control Act was part of an Act passed in 1980, which opened the discount window for the Fed, enabling a host of financial institutions to borrow from the Federal Reserve. With our new, strengthened Federal Reserve, we may open that window even further, which will provide some much-needed financial stability."
 USA_resource_production_in_alaska:0 "Exploit ANWR"
 USA_resource_production_in_alaska_desc:0 "Alaska may be cold and inhospitable to any but the most determined Alaskans, but beneath its permafrost, especially in the untouched Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve, lies a wealth of natural resources that are ripe for the taking. We should work towards boosting Alaskan resource extraction to reap the bounties."
 USA_build_additional_steel_factories:0 "American Steel"
 USA_build_additional_steel_factories_desc:0 "The American steel industry has stagnated in recent years. It is imperative we expand our steel industry in order to meet the vast demand we have here in the United States."
 USA_revive_the_rust_belt:0 "Revive the Rust Belt"
 USA_revive_the_rust_belt_desc:0 "The vast areas of what was once known as the Steel Belt have for several decades languished due to loss of jobs, loss of population, and overall loss of hope. The industries have largely moved out and left behind a disillusioned, poor, and struggling populace. If any part of our country could benefit from a boost to industrial growth, this is the place."
 USA_strengthen_the_military_industrial_complex:0 "Reinforce the Military-Industrial Complex"
 USA_strengthen_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "There are those who claim that the so-called military-industrial complex is an opaque cabal of unscrupulous businessmen who profit from the deaths of millions of innocent people. And then there are those that view them as an excellent business partner."
 USA_factory_worker_rights:0 "Strengthen OSHA and the NLRB"
 USA_factory_worker_rights_desc:0 "Increasing the enforcement powers of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and increasing the power of unions through expanding the National Labor Relations Board, would increase the happiness and productivity of our factory workers without having to do anything too radical."
 USA_dodd_frank_plan:0 "Dodd-Frank Plan"
 USA_dodd_frank_plan_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, economic recession is looming. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is slated to contain the largest changes to financial regulation since the Great Depression, and will completely revamp several aspects of the economy in order to stabilize it and stop any further spiral into recession."
 USA_chromium_and_tungsten_production:0 "Chromium and Tungsten Production"
 USA_chromium_and_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Chromium and tungsten both have important military applications, but neither are found naturally under American soil, or, at least, none that we've found so far. Still, if we prioritize R&D of new mining equipment, we will at the very least be prepared to extract whatever deposits we do come across."
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rust_belt:0 "Encourage Growth in the Rust Belt"
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rust_belt_desc:0 "The Rust Belt is overgrown with the derelict buildings of old, abandoned industry from better days. At this point, it may be better to just flatten all the old ruins and make room for any newcomers."
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rocky_mountains:0 "Encourage Growth in the Rocky Mountains"
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rocky_mountains_desc:0 "The rugged Rocky Mountains are not exactly be the first choice for any strapping young entrepreneur looking to start the next runaway success. Perhaps with a little time and investment in the right places, we could change that."
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south:0 "Encourage Growth in the American South"
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south_desc:0 "The South was never the most financially successful part of the United States, but by the late 20th century, their service sector, manufacturing base, and energy industry seemed to grow almost exponentially. If we want to keep up this momentum in the new millennium, we'll need to ensure that the budding industries have room to expand."
 USA_military_industry_1:0 "Fund New Armories"
 USA_military_industry_1_desc:0 "Expanding our arms factories will help keep up with the large demand of guns for both public and private use."
 USA_naval_production_contracts:0 "Naval Production Contracts"
 USA_naval_production_contracts_desc:0 "Now that we've centralized large parts of the defense sector, the logical next step is the Navy. Our first order of business is contracting willing manufacturers to kickstart our naval production."
 USA_revive_indiana:0 "Revive Indiana"
 USA_revive_indiana_desc:0 "The self-proclaimed Hoosier State admittedly handled the Rust Belt situation better than many of its neighbors, but the steel production in the Calumet region is still far lower than expected. We need to rectify this."
 USA_revive_michigan:0 "Revive Michigan"
 USA_revive_michigan_desc:0 "Michigan used to be known as the center of the automotive industry, but the state today is a husk of its former self, with cities such as Detroit struggling under a stagnant economy. If we were to bring the steel industry back to Michigan, it would go a long way towards reinvigorating the entirety of the Great Lakes State."
 USA_civilian_industry_rocky_mountains:0 "Civilian Industry: Rocky Mountains"
 USA_civilian_industry_rocky_mountains_desc:0 "To an outsider, the Rocky Mountains may seem like an odd place for an industrial hub. We may need to financially support a few pioneers in order to really get the ball rolling."
 USA_civilian_industry_midwest:0 "Civilian Industry: Midwest"
 USA_civilian_industry_midwest_desc:0 "The Midwest may not have the flashy style of Hollywood or the fast-talking business magnates of New York City, but it has honest, dependable and hard-working people. It's time to mobiilize that resource and expand our industrial capacity in the Midwestern states."
 USA_naval_production_increase:0 "The Spirit of Rosie the Riveter"
 USA_naval_production_increase_desc:0 "With both a firm grip on the military production and willing naval contractors under our influence, we can now launch a dedicated naval development program to ensure that all future expansion of naval production will be swift and efficiently coordinated."
 USA_military_industry_2:0 "Dispersed Industrial Construction"
 USA_military_industry_2_desc:0 "The world's greatest military might requires the world's greatest military-industrial complex. Luckily, we have just the place for further expansion."
 #American Politics
 USA_american_ideas:0 "The American Political System"
 USA_american_ideas_desc:0 "The American political landscape is a dual-party system which allows for little room for other parties, and has been this way since the early days of the nation. With the two major parties benefiting heavily from this arrangement, this will be the American political reality so long as the establishment retains its hold on the United States' governmental process."
 USA_the_patriot_act:0 "The Patriot Act"
 USA_the_patriot_act_desc:0 "The USA PATRIOT Act was passed in direct response to a major terror attack on the United States.

 #Status Quo
 USA_status_quo:0 "The Big Two"
 USA_status_quo_desc:0 "The §Y[conservatism_L]§! and §Y[liberalism_L]§! are the major two parties in the United States. The two parties are a culmination of literally centuries of American thought as parties consolidated into two major blocks. Although there are minor parties, they do not have nearly as many supporters or resources as the §Y[conservatism_L]§! and the §Y[liberalism_L]§!"
 USA_pro_democratic_gerrymandering:0 "Pro-Democratic Gerrymandering"

 USA_common_sense_gun_laws:0 "Common Sense Gun Laws"
 USA_common_sense_gun_laws_desc:0 "The gun laws in the United States are lax, designed for an age when muzzle-loading muskets were the only option, and are no longer built for our modern society, with its readily available automatic and semi-automatic weaponry. With the horror of the 1999 Columbine school massacre fresh in our memories, it is time we take a close and hard look at our gun laws in the United States."
 USA_free_college:0 "Free Higher Education"

 USA_liberalization_policies:0 "Liberalization Policies"
 USA_liberalization_policies_desc:0 "The majority of the Democratic party supports harshening some regulations. However, while maintaining our control over most sectors, we could still liberalize some others that would benefit without much risk to us, and get the best of both worlds."
 USA_enforce_traditonal_christian_values:0 "Enforce Christian Values"

 USA_abolish_the_electoral_college_desc:0 "Why stop at merely reforming the College?

 USA_progressive_ideology:0 "Give Progressivism a Chance!"

 USA_radical_taxation_reform_desc:0 "To fund new public services and infrastructure for us all, we will need a lot more revenue than we currently take in. Fortunately, there are massive funds just waiting to be used, rotting in the accounts and assets of the super-rich. To get at this, we will need a wealth tax. The fat cats' bought politicians will howl, but it will be worth it."
 USA_fight_nationalistic_factions:0 "Fight Nationalistic Factions"

 USA_censor_public_opinion_desc:0 "Doing all that we've done was never going to be easy. However, there has been an immense public backlash, even more than we expected, and to protect progress, it seems that we have no choice but to take extraordinary measures to protect our movement from subversive wreckers. It is for their own good - we must always keep that in mind. No cost too great."

 USA_recolonize_the_philippines:0 "Reassert American Dominance in the Philippines"
 USA_recolonize_the_philippines_desc:0 "The Philippines was once American, but we idiotically gave it away soon after WW2. Clearly, in light of recent history, they are in need of new management. We need to reassert our rule in the islands for their own good and ours."
 USA_recolonize_liberia:0 "Take Control of Liberia"
 USA_recolonize_liberia_desc:0 "Liberia was established by America in Africa, and we have always had close ties, even today. However, due to their blatant ineptitude in running their nation, it would be best for us to cease pretending and simply assume direct control."

 USA_flames_in_mexico:0 "Support the Perredistas"
 USA_flames_in_mexico_desc:0 "Perhaps the solution to the liberation of Mexican workers from the iron fists of the Cartels is not domestic police action, but by bringing Mexico under our wings. We can work with like-minded Mexicans to restore order, but the existing government might resist..."

 USA_seek_proximity_to_china_desc:0 "While we had something nice with Japan, realpolitik dictates that the ever-growing might of China presents the greater reward of the two major East Asian powers.

 donald_trump.0.t:0 "The Travel Ban"
 donald_trump.0.d:0 "With terrorism afoot around the globe, it is imperative we protect our citizens. We can protect Americans through enacting the Executive Order titled 'Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,' banning the residents of certain Muslim-majority countries with high prevalences of Muslim extremists. These countries, listed by the Obama administration, are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia.\n\nHowever, getting this ban through without legal trouble may be difficult if we just include these countries, so expanding the ban to places like Venezuela, Chad, and North Korea would help dilute the list of countries and perhaps give us a better chance of having no legal trouble in the first place. It would take additional time to change, however. Do be aware that enacting this policy may have us face reciprocal policies from countries affected by our policy.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 donald_trump.0.o1:0 "Keep the ban limited"

This complaint is made despite the Constitution giving the President 'unreviewable authority' over immigration matters.\n\nWe have appealed this decision, but whatever the constitution says doesn't matter, it's what the court decides, and thus far, it seems stacked against us. Rewriting the Executive Order would perhaps allow us to better prepare against these lawsuits. Alternatively, we could just either try to push the current ban through or withdraw from a Travel Ban altogether. What shall we do, Mr. President?"

Unfortunately, unlike the previous ban, we cannot really change the ban much without angering much of our base, so a move like that would be political suicide.

 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 donald_trump.8.t:0 "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 donald_trump.8.d:0 "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 donald_trump.8.o1:0 "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."

 donald_trump.9.t:0 "Asteroid Spotted"
 donald_trump.9.d:0 "Recently, our scientists at NASA spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the AMI, as some doubted if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than the state of New York. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never been done before. In the meantime, NASA engineers, and even private enterprises like SpaceX, have invented mechanisms to mine the asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 donald_trump.9.o1:0 "Let's get that baby into orbit"

 donald_trump.10.t:0 "Asteroid in Orbit"
 donald_trump.10.d:0 "With the asteroid in orbit, NASA and SpaceX are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. NASA is mainly concerned about collecting scientific data, while SpaceX is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among SpaceX or NASA that competition will arive."
 donald_trump.10.o1:0 "Mining shall begin"

 donald_trump.11.t:0 "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 donald_trump.11.d:0 "After establishing mining operations, SpaceX and NASA have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and markets around the globe. The world has jelously looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 donald_trump.11.o1:0 "Huzzah!"

 donald_trump.12.t:0 "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.12.d:0 "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 donald_trump.12.o1:0 "Excellent!"

 donald_trump.13.t:0 "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.d:0 "Recently, Donald Trump has allowed NASA and SpaceX, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some, however, have cited the massive bill the United States had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the United States for quite a while.\n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"

 donald_trump.23.d:0 "Mr. President, with funding secured, and plans complete, we can now prepare a group of men and women to withstand the immense pressure and loneliness in space in order to reach Mars.\n\nLuckily, NASA has already been preparing for such a trip for years, it's just not had the funding to launch a full program. The additional training of current astronauts and preparation of the rocket will start in earnest.\n\nThis process will take roughly a year for it to complete. In the mean time, scientists at NASA laboratories are preparing scientific equipment to be sent along with the astronauts to Mars to collect useful scientific data that one cannot achieve with a rover. Do keep in mind, SpaceX may attempt to get a man there first upon hearing the announcement."
 donald_trump.23.o1:0 "Preparations shall begin"

 donald_trump.24.t:0 "Space Race"
 donald_trump.24.d:0 "In a recent news release, SpaceX has decided to launch its own program to get to Mars in under a year. Now, if SpaceX gets there first, it will still be an achievement that you can use for additional investment into space, however, it will be... let's just say... not as politically convinient.\n\nThis new Space Race for Mars will require additional investment if we are wanting to secure victory first, however, some experts argue that Elon Musk's program lacks certain aspects required to go to Mars with a crewed mission there and back. We may just be able to get to Mars first without assigning additional funds to NASA.\n\nWhat is your directive, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.24.o1:0 "Space Race it is!"

 donald_trump.14.t:0 "Mission to Mars Ready"
 donald_trump.14.d:0 "NASA has just sent confirmation that the astronauts, equipment, and rocket are ready. There are six particular astronauts heading to Mars with a return journey. The astronauts heading to Mars are as follows: Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne. These astronauts have prepared over the past two years, and are the most fit astronauts for this mission. The rocket, NASA's recent Space Launch System, is ready to be launched. The capsule, the Orion Space Capsule, is also ready.\n\nFortunately, the next launch window is in 30 days."

 donald_trump.15.d:0 "[GetDateText]:\nOur six astronauts are ready. It will be a long difficult journey, but they are prepared for it. Paul seems especially excited about the prospect, while the rest of the crew is nervous, particularly Rodney, albeit willing.\n\nThe Astronauts are in the rocket, ready to blast off into Space. They gave their farewells to family and friends, for they will not see them in person for nearly two years. All are optimistic for a successful mission.\n\nThe countdown has begun, with the launch confirmed."

Its crew are both ecstatic and relieved, as it's a perfect launch. Everything has worked so far, and there is much hope that it will continue to work for months to come.\n\nThe dream is near complete."
 donald_trump.16.o1:0 "An exciting day in history"

 donald_trump.17.t:0 "Disaster Strikes!"
 donald_trump.17.d:0 "The rocket has exploded!\n\nIt turns out that the essential final checks were inadequate to stop a catastrophe. It has been reported that all six crew members, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne, have died in this calamity. The spectators on the ground are watching in disbelief as flames engulf the launch pad. It will much weaken the will for space in the coming future, and will be a stain on your presidency."
 donald_trump.17.o1:0 "A fatal accident"

 donald_trump.18.t:0 "Insanity in Space"
 donald_trump.18.d:0 "It turns out that prolonged periods in isolation with only five others to talk to are not suitable at all for the human psyche.\n\nDespite going through severe training before-hand, one astronaut, Michael, went mentally insane and attempted to manually control the craft to return to Earth as soon as possible. Anne, the only other person awake at the time, attempted to get in his way and halt him, however, she was unable to wrestle him away from the controls. While she was attempting to do this, Michael punched Anne in the jaw, knocking her unconcious.\n\nFortunately, the other crew members were wakened by the disorder, and immediately jumped to aid Anne. A quick struggle ensued where the control panel was slightly dented, however, everything remains operational and Michael is now in a makeshift prison with makeshift handcuffs. Additional good news, Anne was not permanently injured, and will be able to recover within a week on the vessel. Whether she has long term damage would have to be investigated by doctors at home.\n\nThe bad news is that the rocket is widely off-course. Additionally, a lot of fuel was burned in Michael's hasty attempt to return to Earth.\n\nThere are two options: Return to Earth with all the astronauts, arresting Michael for assualt and endangering five other lives, or send them on a one way trip to Mars. The five astronauts have expressed that they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of humanity.\n\nMr. President. What is your choice?"

The other astronauts, other than Mary, have offered their services again to space, while Mary has decided to retire from her astronaut career early.

 #Lunar Outpost Event Chain

 donald_trump.26.t:0 "Outpost on the Moon"
 donald_trump.26.d:0 "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 donald_trump.26.o1:0 "Launch!"

 donald_trump.27.t:0 "Moonbase Alpha"
 donald_trump.27.d:0 "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 donald_trump.27.o1:0 "Science!"

 donald_trump.28.t:0 "Colony Progresses"
 donald_trump.28.d:0 "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 donald_trump.28.o1:0 "We're good at being pioneers"

 donald_trump.29.t:0 "Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.29.d:0 "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 donald_trump.29.o1:0 "Send emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.29.o2:0 "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

 donald_trump.30.t:0 "Colony Progresses Further"
 donald_trump.30.d:0 "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 donald_trump.30.o1:0 "Life continues on"

 donald_trump.31.t:0 "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.31.d:0 "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurance, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the saftey of the modules. After the previous explosion, NASA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. NASA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so NASA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 donald_trump.31.o1:0 "Send more emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.31.o2:0 "We can't continue doing things like this"

 donald_trump.32.t:0 "Moonbase Beta"
 donald_trump.32.d:0 "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase.With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entreprenuers and corporations are flooding to NASA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your dilligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and American."

Not only that, but welfare programs give money to immigrants, even undocumented immigrants.\n\nThis system needs to be fixed, but neither side can agree to fix it, so it remains broken, for now."

 made_in_china_desc:0 "Many of our corporations have moved their industry from here to China. When we allowed China into the WTO in 2001, this was not the prospect we hoped for. What makes this worse is that China violates our intellectual property rights, stealing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of intellectual property each year. Not only this, but they are becoming ever more powerful and hostile to us. The last thing we want is to be attached to a more powerful, hostile regime."
