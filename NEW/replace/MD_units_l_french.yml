 Militia_Bat:0 "Militia"
 Militia_Bat_desc:0 "Militia Battalion on foot. Militia Units are characterized by having less heavy equipment and communication kits than normal infantry. This makes them highly mobile and effective in bad terrain, but they melt away quickly in flat terrain against an armored opponent."

 L_Inf_Bat:0 "Light Infantry"
 L_Inf_Bat_desc:0 "Light Infantry without transports. Rarely seen on the modern battlefield, but specialized units in very difficult terrain such as jungle and mountains exist - where they are highly effective. Could also be useful as urban garrisons."
 Mot_Inf_Bat:0 "Motorized Infantry"

 L_Air_Inf_Bat:0 "Airborne Light Infantry"
 L_Air_Inf_Bat_desc:0 "Airborne Light Infantry are elite Infantry, with their special training in Aerial Insertion via paradrops from Transport Aircraft or with Transport Helicopters. They can rapidly respond to emergencies from afar, and can be inserted behind enemy lines to take vital objectives ahead of the main army advance. Their mode of transport puts strict limits on the amount of heavy equipment they can carry, though."

 Arm_Air_Inf_Bat_desc:0 "Armored Airborne Infantry are elite Infantry, with their special training in Aerial Insertion via paradrops from Transport Aircraft. They can rapidly respond to emergencies from afar, and can be inserted behind enemy lines to take vital objectives ahead of the main army advance. Their specially designed Light Infantry Fighting Vehicles gives them great mobility, and allows them to fight on equal terms against normal mechanized formations. It is however, extremely logistically demanding to paradrop them together with their IFV's. As of 2017, only Russia has ever operated such forces."
