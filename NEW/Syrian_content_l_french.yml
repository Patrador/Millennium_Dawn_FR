 SYR_assad_day_desc:0 "The Assad family has ruled Syria for decades. The victory in the civil war has only semented their position. As we celebrate victory, we will hold meetings with our allies Russia and Iran. Since they played such a big role in the victory, they will most likely try to heavily influence our politics. We should be careful not to go against their wishes too many times."

 SYR_incorporate_ssnp_desc:0 "The Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or the SSNP, is a party which aims for the creation of Greater Syria.

Before the war, Syria had rather war relations with them, until they started supporting the FSA, altough according to their own words only to fight ISIS.
