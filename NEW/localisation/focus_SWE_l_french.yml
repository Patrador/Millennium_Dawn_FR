 SWE_post_crisis_fiscal_decisions:0 "Post-Crisis Fiscal Decisions"
 SWE_post_crisis_fiscal_decisions_desc:0 "The Swedish economy, once equipped with the highest incomes in Europe during the 70s, has not managed to stay ahead of the rest. Especially the Crisis of the 90s, when GDP dropped by 5% at the beginning of the decade, scarred the once untouchable Swedish money machine. The 1994 budget had a deficit of 15% the GDP. Now, the government needs to set a convincing policy for the new millennium."
 SWE_riksbank_policy:0 "Riksbank Policy"
 SWE_riksbank_policy_desc:0 "The Sveriges Riksbank is Sweden's central bank, active since 1668 and in charge of managing the Swedish Krona, the national currency. The central bank's actions might be central to the fiscal and even diplomatic stance of the government."
 SWE_currency_policy:0 "Currency Policy"
 SWE_currency_policy_desc:0 "Inflation and deflation are always central possibilities to consider. As long as Sweden hold's the Krona as its exclusive and very own currency, the Riksbank can control the amount of money in circulation and thus the value of the currency on the national and international markets."
 SWE_improve_the_stridsvagn_122:0 "Improve the Stridsvagn 122"
 SWE_improve_the_stridsvagn_122_desc:0 "The Stridsvagn 122 is a licensed version of the German Leopard 2A5 main battle tank. Specialized for forest combat, the Stridsvagn still could be the subject of military experiments to perhaps make the next generation of Swedish tanks an even more effective - and maybe this time less German - family of war machines."
 SWE_contracts_for_german_armament_companies:0 "Contracts for German Armament Companies"
 SWE_contracts_for_german_armament_companies_desc:0 "The Swedish military sector has never been massive to begin with and its size has also drained over the decades, especially since the end of the Cold War has put 'armed neutrality' a bit further down on government priorities. While we cannot make sure that our weaponry will be perfect ourselves, the Germans certainly would be happy to. Maybe we should consider hiring them."
 SWE_oresund_bridge:0 "Öresund Bridge"
 SWE_oresund_bridge_desc:0 "Under construction since the late 1990s, the Öresundsbron (Danish Øresundsbroen) is a massive bridge-and-tunnel project to connect Malmö in southern Sweden with Copenhagen, capital city of Denmark. This would mark a new connection between southern Fennoscandia and the European mainland and make trade easier with the Danes as well as the Germans and other European countries."
 SWE_expand_e20:0 "Expand E20"
 SWE_expand_e20_desc:0 "E20, one of the trans-European roads of the E-road network, connects, among others, Denmark and Sweden over the newly constructed Öresund bridge to then run north towards Stockholm, where the road is continued by ferry towards Estonia and Russia. We should make sure traffic over E20 can run freely; for what helps our partners, helps us."
 SWE_expand_malmo_harbor:0 "Expand Malmö Harbor"
 SWE_expand_malmo_harbor_desc:0 "With the Öresund completed, we should also focus on making Malmö a new attractive maritime alternative to Göteborg. This would allow our southern trade partners in Denmark, Germany and Poland to more effectively and more quickly ship goods onto the Swedish mainland."
 SWE_expand_the_merchant_fleet:0 "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
 SWE_expand_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "With wealth, one should make sure to create the basis for more wealth. By constructing an impressive amount of convoys, we should be able to make sure that Sweden literally stays afloat when it comes to economic competitiveness."
 SWE_expand_the_stockholm_docks:0 "Expand the Stockholm Docks"
 SWE_expand_the_stockholm_docks_desc:0 "Our most important window into the eastern Baltic and towards Finland, Estonia and Russia is the port system of our capital system, Stockholm. We should expand it to make trade with these countries easier and less of a hassle."
 SWE_northern_friendship:0 "Northern Friendship"
 SWE_northern_friendship_desc:0 "Sweden is a nation of peace and there is no reason to change that. We should focus on building lucrative and cordial relations with our European partners, friends and allies."
 SWE_friendship_with_denmark:0 "Friendship with Denmark"
 SWE_friendship_with_denmark_desc:0 "Sweden and Denmark required quite a while to discover their love for each other, going to war more than twenty times over the course of the last ten centuries. But Denmark and Sweden, the former the inspiration of the latter's flag, the latter clearly superior to the former in all the other ways, have found each other as friends and partners. And sometimes rivals. Damn danskjävlar."
 SWE_friendship_with_norway:0 "Friendship with Norway"
 SWE_friendship_with_norway_desc:0 "Norway was by Sweden's side for a long time - both figuratively and geographically. But while the weird shape of their country is a tale of it's own, it is undeniable that the friendship of our two nations has been of mutual benefit. Even though they chose divorce in 1905. That was rude."
 SWE_friendship_with_the_baltic_states:0 "Friendship with the Baltic States"
 SWE_friendship_with_the_baltic_states_desc:0 "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania share a lot with the Nordic countries - or so they say. While we still attempt to find out which cultural similarities other than a vague linguistic relationship between the Estonian and Finnish languages is supposed to tie Northern Europe to that part of Eastern Europe, we might as well make them our friends already. Why not?"
 SWE_swedish_norwegian_steel_production:0 "Swedish-Norwegian Steel Production"
 SWE_swedish_norwegian_steel_production_desc:0 "The borderlands of Sweden and Norway are both rich in natural resources and hard to reach. Maybe, by working together, our two countries can find common ground to stand on. And other, divided, ground that we can mine and sell to the highest bidder."
 SWE_friendship_with_finland:0 "Friendship with Finland"
 SWE_friendship_with_finland_desc:0 "Finland has been our loyal neighbor since their independence. And while they wouldn't make the same claims regarding our loyalty after the debacle of the Winter War, our nations are generally on somewhat good terms, especially considering that Finland-Swedes are an important minorities that the two nations need to somewhat take care of together."
 SWE_job_opportunities_in_scania:0 "Job Opportunities in Scania"
 SWE_job_opportunities_in_scania_desc:0 "With foreign people and businesses alike flocking into southern Sweden, we can afford to sponsor the creation of jobs in this region. More customers means more demand, which means more potential for growth.
 SWE_friendship_with_iceland:0 "Friendship with Iceland"
 SWE_friendship_with_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland is a sight to behold and diplomatically the perhaps least controversial country on earth. Not being Iceland's friend is pretty much a sin."
 SWE_expand_e6:0 "Expand E6"
 SWE_expand_e6_desc:0 "E6, which leads all the way from northern Norway down to Oslo and from there to the southern tip of Sweden, is one of the most important trade and travel routes between Sweden and its oil-loving, super rich western neighbor. We should cherish the Norwego-Swedish relationship and the trade dynamic of our two nations by keeping the road intact and making it more accessible on our side."
 SWE_further_european_integration:0 "Further European Integration"
 SWE_further_european_integration_desc:0 "While Sweden is skeptical of pan-European ideas just from a cultural standpoint, further economic integration has proven undeniably effective. The Germans are buying our stuff and we are buying German stuff. The Danish are buying our stuff and we are buying Danish stuff. Let's sell and buy more stuff."
 SWE_reform_the_diplomatic_agenda:0 "Reform the Diplomatic Agenda"
 SWE_reform_the_diplomatic_agenda_desc:0 "The world stage is a very precarious area of affairs and a single misstep can cost thousands of jobs or even millions of lives. We need to make sure Sweden only uses the best of the best when it comes to ambassadors, serving Swedish interests with determination but not so openly as to offend our partners."
 SWE_invite_european_experts:0 "Invite European Experts"
 SWE_invite_european_experts_desc:0 "Our European Partners have the personnel needed to solve almost any problem we might face. By inviting them and gathering them in Stockholm, we could gain a new resource of knowledge to draw from."
 SWE_befriend_germany:0 "Befriend Germany"
 SWE_befriend_germany_desc:0 "Germany is Sweden's most important destination of exports and the most important origin of imports. To offend the Germans would mean jeopardizing our entire economy."

 SWE_northern_nationalism:0 "Northern Nationalism"
 SWE_northern_nationalism_desc:0 "Perhaps, our neighbors are not as puny as one might anticipate when looking at how their flags are generally just inferior versions of ours. Forming a united identity and a united nationalistic fervor, directed against the rest of world, might make our dreams forged by alcohol become a reality forged by blood."
 SWE_justify_swedish_imperialism:0 "Justify Swedish Imperialism"
 SWE_justify_swedish_imperialism_desc:0 "Generally, the Swedish colonial endeavors of old are seen as laughable footnotes of history in the modern times. Sweden holding Estonia and Danzig? Colonizing in North America? How silly, right? No longer! These attempts at realizing a Swedish empire under a Swedish sovereign have to be not our subject of ridicule, but our subject of admiration."

 SWE_animosity_towards_russia:0 "Animosity towards Russia"

But 'Emperor of Sweden' sounds like a ruler that is going to make Sweden great again, make Estonia a colony again and make the King of Belgium look like an idiot."
