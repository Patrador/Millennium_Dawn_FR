Early morning today, several suspected Al-Qaeda members were arrested at the Logan International Airport in Boston and the Dulles International Airport in Waschington D.C.. Despite these early warnings, five terrorists manage to board Flight 93 at the Newark International Airport in New York. As they tried to hijack the flight, resistance from passengers eventually led to them crashing the plane into a field in Stonycreek Township in Pennsylvania. The crew of seven and 33 passengers and the five hijackers were all killed in the crash.\n\nBased on our current intelligence, the planes were intended to be crashed to several targets on the East Coast, including the World Trade Center, Pentagon and the Capitol building.\n\nFortunately our intelligence services were on the lookout, and we managed to prevent a terrible tragedy."

Not so with Balbir Singh Sodhi.\n\nThe Indian-born Sikh was mistakenly identified as Muslim (because of his middle eastern complexion and his turban) by 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque at Singh's gas station in Mesa, Arizona. Singh was subsequently shot dead by Roque from his truck with a .380 handgun. Roque fled the scene and, twenty minutes later, tried to kill another person, a Lebanon-born store clerk .\nAfter failing at this assassination attempt, Roque ended his terror spree at his own former residence, now taken up by an Afghan family, firing shots at the building but causing no casualties.
