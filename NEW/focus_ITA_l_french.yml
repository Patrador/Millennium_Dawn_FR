 italy_md.31.t:0 "Criminals sabotage our military!"

Wh can say for certain though that the last remains of the Mafia will soon be arrested and put on process, we are likely to achieve victory soon."
 italy_md.31.o1:0 "We are still in time to stop now!"

 italy_news.2.o1:0 "Long live the King!"
 italy_news.2.o2:0 "What an Interesting Development."
 italy_news.3.t:0 "The Roman Empire is back!"
 italy_news.3.d:0 "It sounds like a writing prompt, but it is reality. Earlier today, fascist supporters in Italy broke into the Parliament and declared that the Republic was over, and it was going to be replaced by a new Fascist government. The new Italian government claims to be the Roman Empire, and aims to recover the lands of the old Empire. Will this happen through diplomacy or war? Only time will tell..."

 italy_news.5.d:0 "'The European Union has been slowly taking steps towards more and more cooperation between the European Countries. Years and years of wars and battles have finally ended and Europe is now moving towards a process of unification. Since the creation of the EU there has been a huge development of the countries who agrees to Schengen, Eurozon, but by unifying the whole continent under a single government and banner, Europe will finally show to the world that the old powers are still to be considered on par with the growing economies of Asia and America. The last step towards European unification has been taken."

 italy_news.8.o2:0 "Ok"
 italy_news.9.t:0 "Italian war on Mafia is a failure!"
 italy_news.9.d:0 "Apparently, news coming from Italy tell us that not even the biggest of their attempts ended up into finally eradicating Mafia from Italy. The feared criminal organization's counter-attacks to stop the Italian government from cutting their powers proved to be enough to make Italy stop messing with them, effectively stopping the 'war' on Mafia."
 italy_news.9.o1:0 "We had to"
 italy_news.9.o2:0 "Interesting development"
