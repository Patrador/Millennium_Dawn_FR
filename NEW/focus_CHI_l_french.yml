  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc:0 "In order to make up for defence budget cuts, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the budget."
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC:0 "The Future of the CPC"
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc:0 "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought:0 "Three Represents Thought"
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought_desc:0 "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin.

  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance_desc:0 "The Chinese Communist Youth League is an influential organization that has groomed a large number of Communist Party officials, including vice-president Hu Jintao.

  CHI_End_Class_Warfare:0 "End Class Warfare"
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance."
  CHI_Hu_Jintao_Agenda:0 "Hu Jintao's Agenda"
  CHI_Hu_Jintao_Agenda_desc:0 "The rise of the Communist Youth League or Tuanpai faction has allowed Hu Jintao to assume leadership of the People's Republic of China. His vision for the country is one that is less growth-oriented and more in-tune with those left behind by China's rapid development than Jiang's."
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise:0 "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc:0 "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."

  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development_desc:0 "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."

  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema_desc:0 " America has Hollywood, India has Bollywood. Even Nigeria has Nollywood. The Chinese film industry has historically had little success beyond China’s borders, failing even to achieve substantial popularity within China itself.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc:0 "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation. Zeng will have to overcome his limited popularity in the party relative to figures like Hu Jintao and Wen Jiaobao to push his reformist agenda."

  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military_desc:0 "In order to make changes to the composition of the Communist Party, Zeng Qinghong must make use of his connections to powerful military generals. These ties must be strengthened before any inevitably unpopular reformist agenda is pursued."

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc:0 "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people. Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people."
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy:0 "Intra-Party Democracy"
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc:0 "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries. Now that he has come to power, this idea can be expanded to encompass a range of new reforms to increase transparency and accountability within the communist party."
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy:0 "Increase Local Autonomy"

  CHI_Public_Examinations:0 "Public Examinations"
  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc:0 "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment. This policy will require a more substantial party bureaucracy."
  CHI_Succession_Question:0 "The Succession Question"
  CHI_Succession_Question_desc:0 "While the princeling vice-president Xi Jinping is widely considered to be the most likely choice to succeed the current president, his fellow princeling Bo Xilai has been a rising star in Chinese politics for several years now and came close to threatening Xi’s ascension to the position of vice-president."

  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda:0 "Xi Jinping's Agenda"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda_desc:0 "With Bo Xilai out of the way, the path is clear for a smooth transition of power to vice-president Xi Jinping. A princeling who does not fit squarely within either the Tuanpai/Youth League Faction or the Shanghai Clique, Xi will have to build consensus and achieve compromise within the politically turbulent communist party."
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought:0 "Xi Jinping Thought"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought_desc:0 "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party. What sets this particular theory apart from those of most of Xi's predecessors is the extent to which adherance to this ideology is tied to loyalty. Loyalty to the party, loyalty to the country, but also significantly, loyalty to Xi Jinping himself."
  CHI_China_Dream:0 "The Chinese Dream"

  CHI_Flowing_Spring:0 "Flowing Spring"
  CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc:0 "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled "Flowing Spring" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity. Rather than a more moderated approach to China's future, the concept of the flowing spring calls upon Chinese citizens to regain their lost greatness and achieve the most they possibly can."
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society:0 "Xiaokang Society"
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society_desc:0 "The idea of a moderately prosperous society is not a new one in Chinese politics. Nonethless, Xi Jinping has decided to give this concept a new lease of life, calling upon the nation to strive for a country that is equally and only moderately well-off."

  CHI_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc:0 "The time has come for us to start securing our grip on power. Many political rivals of [CHI.GetLeader] remain politically active and constitute a threat, however slim, to our government.

  CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League_desc:0 "The populist coalition headed by the Tuanpai or Youth League Faction retains significant influence due to the significant degree of independence possessed by the Communist Youth League. By reducing this independence and conducting bribery investigations against Youth League members such as Ling Jihua, we can make the Youth League cease to be an important force in Chinese politics."

  CHI_Take_Down_the_Big_Tigers_desc:0 "The elitist coalition, dominated by "princelings" and Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique, retains a large number of high-ranking posts in the CPC. Luckily for us, a large number of this officials are involved in corruption due to the nepotism of Jiang Zemin's government.

  CHI_War_on_Crime:0 "War on Crime"
  CHI_War_on_Crime_desc:0 "During his time as Party secretary of Chongqing, Bo Xilai made fighting organized crime one of his top priorities. Now that he can extend his method of governing to the entire country, it is high time that the corrupt businessmen and triad bosses in the rest of the country meet the same fates as their Chongqing-based brethren."
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model:0 "The Chongqing Model"
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model_desc:0 "The Chongqing Model is Bo Xilai's contribution to Communist Party doctrine. It is a model that includes a wide range of social and economic policies, including "strike black" and "sing red" campaigns that involve fighting organized crime and singing communist songs respectively. The model also represents a slight departure from China's market liberalization policies."

  CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms_desc:0 "Labor disputes are a significant hinderance to the government's legitimacy.

  CHI_Humanist_Marxism:0 "Humanist Marxism"
  CHI_Humanist_Marxism_desc:0 "The "New Left" ideology put forward by Bo Xilai and others is one that favours a return to aspects of Maoist socialism such as state-planning and collectivism. Now that he has come to power, Bo can pursue his leftist agenda under the banner of "humanist marxism"."
  CHI_Nanjie_Model:0 "The Nanjie Model"
  CHI_Nanjie_Model_desc:0 "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai:0 "Purge the Tuanpai"

  CHI_Promote_Princelings_desc:0 "While the venerable members of Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique have served China well, it is time for them to retire and make way for a new generation of leaders.

  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda:0 "Bo Xilai's Agenda"
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc:0 "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent "New Left" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands:0 "Scrap Military Commands"
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc:0 "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict. To remedy this, we should regroup these military commands into four strategic zones: North, South, East and West. However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers:0 "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc:0 "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force. In order to make our military more mobile, nimble, and responsive, we should reduce our reliance on the ground forces by cutting troop numbers."
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption:0 "Stamp Out Corruption"
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."

  CHI_De_Politicize_the_Military_desc:0 "While the PLA's loyalty to the CPC ensures the security and stability of our one-party state, it is undeniable that this politicization of the military has, at least in part, diminished the ability of the PLA to function as an effective war-fighting force."

  CHI_Let_a_Hundred_Flowers_Bloom_desc:0 "In 1956, Mao Zedong initiated the Hundred Flowers Campaign, calling for Chinese citizens to openly air their grievances towards the government. While that campaign ended in repression and a return to the status quo, a reboot of the same campaign does not necessarily have to end the same way."

  CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles_desc:0 "Deng Xiaoping's Four Cardinal Principles included upholding the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and Maozedong thought. The inclusion of these principles means that debate about the nature of authoritarian rule in China has not been allowed.

  CHI_Drop_Claims_on_Bhutan:0 "Drop Claims on Bhutan"
  CHI_Drop_Claims_on_Bhutan_desc:0 "A major barrier to improving relations between us and Bhutan are our claims over some of the territory that they control. This has also led to friction with the Indians, friction that could potentially lead to an undesirable conflict. It is best that we drop these claims for now."
  CHI_Doklam_Road_Standoff:0 "Doklam Road Standoff"
  CHI_Doklam_Road_Standoff_desc:0 "Doklam is Chinese territory, and we should therefore be able to move troops and construction equipment through it freely if we so wish. If Bhutan and India wish to respond, let them. This will be a good opportunity to test their combat readiness."
  CHI_Iron_Brothers:0 "Iron Brothers"
  CHI_Iron_Brothers_desc:0 "China and Pakistan are close strategic partners, and this relationship should be preserved for our mutual benefit. Our common Indian foe cannot stand up to our joint might."

  CHI_Militarize_Gwadar_Port_desc:0 "Our investments in Gwadar Port have paid off and produced an impressive commercial facility. We can capitalize on this achievement by preparing the port for military as well as commercial uses, a move that will no doubt intimidate the Indians but a move that is nonetheless necessary for our security."
  CHI_The_Quadrilateral_Cooperation_and_Coordination_Mechanism:0 "Quadrilateral Cooperation Mechanism"
  CHI_The_Quadrilateral_Cooperation_and_Coordination_Mechanism_desc:0 "The Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism or QCCM will be a useful grouping of four countries with a shared interest in combating terrorism. Hopefully it will also improve tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan and help spread our influence in Russian-dominated Central Asia through our Tajik partners."
  CHI_Support_Negotiations:0 "Support Negotiations"
  CHI_Support_Negotiations_desc:0 "Conflict is the problem and not the solution. We should use the QCCM to persuade our partners to adopt conciliatory but guarded approaches towards militants not out of fear but out of necessity."
  CHI_Joint_Operations:0 "Joint Anti-Terrorism Operations"

  CHI_Tackle_the_Root_Causes_of_Radicalization_desc:0 "Now that the terrorist threat has been temporarily reduced we should focus our efforts on de-radicalization. We can cut off the recruitment of militant groups by using investments in infrastructure and industry to alleviate poverty in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan."
  CHI_Disengage_from_Pakistan:0 "Disengage from Pakistan"
  CHI_Disengage_from_Pakistan_desc:0 "It is time to re-evaluate our approach towards the Indian subcontinent. A close partnership between two of the world's largest economies could be more beneficial to us than a continued alliance with a lesser power. Disengaging from Pakistan will be the first step in our rapprochement with India."
  CHI_End_Joint_Military_Exercises:0 "End Joint Military Exercises"
  CHI_End_Joint_Military_Exercises_desc:0 "Our exercises with Pakistan are viewed with suspicion by the Indians. We must end them in order to gain their trust."
  CHI_Strategic_Realignment:0 "Strategic Realignment"
  CHI_Strategic_Realignment_desc:0 "Our gradual shift away from Pakistan is now becoming obvious. It is time to make it clear to the Indians that these moves have been attempts to win their favor."
  CHI_Sino_Indian_Treaty_of_Friendship:0 "Sino-Indian Treaty of Friendship"
  CHI_Sino_Indian_Treaty_of_Friendship_desc:0 "Our partnership with Pakistan was of course not the only source of friction between us and our Indian counterparts. We will need to address the territorial grievances that our respective countries possess in order to begin a new relationship with India."
  CHI_A_New_Alliance:0 "A New Alliance"
  CHI_A_New_Alliance_desc:0 "The remarkable improvement in relations between us and the Indians has opened up a new and valuable opportunity for a military as well as political partnership. An alliance between our two nations represents an unstoppable force in the East and South Asian regions."
  CHI_Strike_Across_the_Himalayas:0 "Strike Across the Himalayas"
  CHI_Strike_Across_the_Himalayas_desc:0 "While we should seek to avoid all-out war for now, we have sufficiently strengthened our position so as to allow for a probe of India's defences. Should we be successful in our endeavour we will have taken back territory that is rightfully ours, and should we fail we will have at least learned more about our enemy's capabilities."
  CHI_String_of_Pearls:0 "String of Pearls"
  CHI_String_of_Pearls_desc:0 "India's dominance over the Indian Ocean is an undesirable state of affairs. We can seek to contain India much in the same way as America is seeking to contain us, namely by encircling our rival with military bases located in the territory of our regional partners. This encirclement will give us a significant advantage should we enter a state of war with India."
  CHI_Annex_Bhutan:0 "Annex Bhutan"
  CHI_Annex_Bhutan_desc:0 "Our claims over Bhutan may not extend over the country's entire territory, but the country's close historical ties to Tibet should provide reasonable justification for our desire to integrate Bhutan into the Tibet Autonomous Region. Moreover, annexation would remove a strategically located Indian ally. Should our influence in Bhutan become sufficiently large we will able to annex the country without a war."
  CHI_Puppet_Nepal:0 "Puppet Nepal"
  CHI_Puppet_Nepal_desc:0 "Some political forces in Nepal are willing to significantly strengthen their country's ties to China at the expense of its partnership with India. This would significantly help our foreign policy objectives. Increasing our influence in the country and ensuring a friendly government is in place will allow us to carry out this process peacefully."
  CHI_Bring_the_Tiger_to_Heel:0 "Cage the Tiger"
  CHI_Bring_the_Tiger_to_Heel_desc:0 "Our rise to regional hegemony will not be possible with a hostile India poised to attack our southern flank and support our enemies.

  CHI_The_Land_of_the_Rising_Sun:0 "The Land of the Rising Sun"
  CHI_The_Land_of_the_Rising_Sun_desc:0 "To our northeast lies a great threat as well as a great opportunity for Chinese foreign policy. We are not convinced that Japan will never again become a threat to the Chinese people, but at the same time it may be useful to have the Japanese on our side in the greater struggle with the United States."
  CHI_Maintain_Historical_Enmity:0 "Maintain Historical Enmity"
  CHI_Maintain_Historical_Enmity_desc:0 "We have looked on, horrified, as the world has allowed Japan to remilitarize and once again become a threat to the Chinese nation. Our quarrel with Japan does not lie simply in the past. It exists here and now so long as that nation of war criminals continues to possess the means of violence."
  CHI_Demand_the_Diaoyu_Islands:0 "Demand the Diaoyu Islands"
  CHI_Demand_the_Diaoyu_Islands_desc:0 "The Diaoyu islands are rightfully ours and are a significant point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations.

  CHI_Incite_Anti_Japanese_Sentiment_desc:0 "It should not be too difficult to incite anti-Japanese fervor amongst our patriotic population, a sentiment that we can use to our advantage in the confrontation that is to come."
  CHI_Clash_Over_the_East_China_Sea:0 "Clash Over the East China Sea"
  CHI_Clash_Over_the_East_China_Sea_desc:0 "We regularly probe Japan's air defences by sending our aircraft into their airspace. It would be all too easy to use one of these instances to spark a much larger crisis..."
  CHI_A_Pragmatic_Approach:0 "A Pragmatic Approach"
  CHI_A_Pragmatic_Approach_desc:0 "Our relations with the Japanese have been marred by their refusal to apologize for or even acknowledge the grave injustices that they inflicted on our people during the Sino-Japanese War. Nonetheless, it may be more strategic to set aside our resentment towards the Japanese in order to facilitate an American withdrawl from East Asia."
  CHI_Assuage_Japanese_Concerns:0 "Assuage Japanese Concerns"
  CHI_Assuage_Japanese_Concerns_desc:0 "In order to facilitate a rapprochement with Japan we need to reassure the Japanese that our intentions are not hostile. Actions speak louder than words."
  CHI_Encourage_Appreciation_of_Japanese_Culture:0 "Encourage Appreciation of Japanese Culture"
  CHI_Encourage_Appreciation_of_Japanese_Culture_desc:0 "Japanese culture is popular among the Chinese people, especially the younger generations.

  CHI_Global_Influence:0 "Global Influence"
  CHI_Global_Influence_desc:0 "Past Chinese dynasties considered the outside world beyond China's immediate periphery as not worthy of our attention. This was what led China to fall behind the industralized nations of the West. We will not make this same mistake again."
  CHI_Favor_Multipolarity:0 "Favor Multipolarity"

  CHI_Support_Security_Council_Reform:0 "Support Security Council Reform"
  CHI_Support_Security_Council_Reform_desc:0 "We have historically opposed broadening the United Nations Security Council to include the G4 countries due to our tense relations with Japan and India. Now that relations have improved we can drop this opposition. Whether reform arises as a result of this depends on the will of the other permanent members of the Security Council."
  CHI_A_Rival_Superpower:0 "A Rival Superpower"
  CHI_A_Rival_Superpower_desc:0 "We had to reassure the world that we were not seeking hegemony in past decades when our nation was in a much weaker position relative to the West. However, now that our country is no longer an underdeveloped nation we no longer have to maintain this facade and can instead openly strive to replace the United States as sole global hegemon."
  CHI_End_US_Hegemony:0 "End US Hegemony"
  CHI_End_US_Hegemony_desc:0 "The US-centric world order is unjust and unsustainable, and we should do our best to ensure its demise. American imperialism must be forced out of the Global South, with the influence of the well-intentioned and the virtuous filling the vacuum that it leaves behind."
  CHI_The_Bears_Backyard:0 "The Bear's Backyard"
  CHI_The_Bears_Backyard_desc:0 "Our strategic partnership with Russia has helped in our goal of undermining American hegemony.

  CHI_A_New_Imperium_desc:0 "Now that our position in the region and the world at large is secure, it is possible for us to restore China to its former glory and revive territorial claims that were previously considered lost forever. The age of empire and a Sino-centric world order will be imposed on the rest of the globe, whether it likes it or not."
  CHI_Form_the_SCO:0 "Form the SCO"
  CHI_Form_the_SCO_desc:0 "Currently the Shanghai Five grouping acts as a way for us to interact closely with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

  CHI_Emphasize_Economic_Cooperation:0 "Emphasize Economic Cooperation"
  CHI_Emphasize_Economic_Cooperation_desc:0 "The SCO should primarily be a facilitator of economic assistance from wealthy members to poorer members.

  CHI_Tackle_Drug_Trafficking_desc:0 "Drug trafficking from Afghanistan is an issue that is difficult for us as an individual country to solve alone but relatively less difficult for a multilateral organization to take on. Together we can more effectively police the porous borders of Central Asia."
  CHI_Emphasize_Military_Cooperation:0 "Emphasize Military Cooperation"
  CHI_Emphasize_Military_Cooperation_desc:0 "There is no need for us to mask our intentions.

  CHI_Chinese_Dominance:0 "Chinese Dominance"
  CHI_Chinese_Dominance_desc:0 "While our position and Russia's within the SCO is currently equal, the inconvenient truth is that our power far outstrips that of our erstwhile allies. Our influence within the organization should correspond to our real-world significance and so Russia should be forced into a junior position."
  CHI_Equal_Partners:0 "Equal Partners"
  CHI_Equal_Partners_desc:0 "Even if we have started to overtake the Russians in a lot of areas we still have much to learn from this former superpower. It serves our interests better to keep the Russians onside than to alienate and antagonize them."

  CHI_ASEAN_Integration_desc:0 "The unspoken function of ASEAN was to balance against our influence, so our efforts to improve relations with the ASEAN member states and end their distrust of us means that the way is now clear to integrate ASEAN into the SCO, significantly boosting the membership of our organization."
  CHI_Undermine_ASEAN:0 "Undermine ASEAN"
  CHI_Undermine_ASEAN_desc:0 "ASEAN exists as a counterweight to our regional influence and so should be done away with. We can exploit the fact that the organization is made up of multiple different nations with wildly varying outlooks. We can target those nations that are most favourable to our interests and convince them to leave the ASEAN and join the SCO."
  CHI_Exploit_Economic_Clout:0 "Exploit Economic Clout"

  CHI_Split_CSTO:0 "Split CSTO"
  CHI_Split_CSTO_desc:0 "Our partnership with Russia was never going to last forever. We have never been able to fully trust our expansionist northern neighbor. While it has served our interests up until now to continue the pretence of Sino-Russian cooperation, in order to take the SCO further we must put it to an end. Our shared allies must now make a choice between siding with us and siding with our enemy."
