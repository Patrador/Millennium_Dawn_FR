Recently this intensified when [From.GetRulingParty] started pushing their [From.GetRulingIdeology] propaganda with a number of speeches and reading material distributed to the [Root.GetAdjective] people. \n\nNow even a number of politicians and other officials are being swayed by the [From.GetAdjective] propaganda, and have started advocating for [From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] in [Root.GetName]."
 generic.1.d_bad: "For a long time the [From.GetAdjective] government has sought to align the path of our countries, and has often tried to meddle in [Root.GetName]'s politics. Recently this has intensified, as [From.GetRulingParty] started pushing their [From.GetRulingIdeology] propaganda with no respect for [Root.GetAdjective] political traditions. A number of speeches and other [From.GetRulingIdeology] material is already being distributed to the [Root.GetAdjective] people.

 election.1.t: "GENERIC ELECTION"
 election.1.d: ""
 election.1.a: ""
 election.2.t: "Election: Public Opposes Rearmament"
 election.2.d: "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."
 election.2.a: "The people must be heard."
 election.2.b: "Protecting our sovereignty comes first."
 election.3.t: "Election: Public Demands Rearmament"
 election.3.d: "The ongoing war approaching our borders has loomed over the upcoming election, with many voters being concerned that [Root.GetName] is not prepared for being thrown into this conflict or whatever may arise from it. They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."
 election.3.a: "The people have the right to feel safe."
 election.3.b: "Many are still in favor of diplomatic solutions."
 election.4.t: "Election: Fascists in Government?"
 election.4.d: "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.4.a: "Rather them than the communists!"
 election.4.b: "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t: "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d: "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.5.a: "Rather reform than revolution!"
 election.5.b: "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.6.t: "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d: "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."
 election.6.a: "We will work with the fascists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 election.6.b: "Joining with the communists, we can facilitate social change."
 election.6.c: "A minority government, although weak, is preferable."
 election.7.t: "Fascists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.7.d: "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.7.a: "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 election.7.b: "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 election.8.t: "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d: "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 election.8.a: "We should embrace our common causes."
 election.8.b: "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."
 election.11.t: "Election: Fascist Majority"
 election.11.d: "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.11.a: "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."
 election.11.b: "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 election.12.t: "Election: Communist Majority"
 election.12.d: "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.12.a: "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 election.12.b: "We must stop them before they abolish every sign of dissenting thought!"
 election.13.t: "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d: "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."
 election.13.a: "He can say what he pleases, we need not endorse it."
 election.13.b: "We cannot rely on fascists to develop and protect [Root.GetName]."
 election.14.t: "Election: Wartime Exception"
 election.14.d: "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."
 election.14.a: "Elections will be held as usual."
 election.14.b: "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 election.15.t: "Election: Government Contested"
 election.15.d: "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."
 election.15.a: "This crisis of trust is highly unfortunate."
 election.15.b: "Let the political landscape shift to keep the people united."
 election.16.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d: "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a: "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t: "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d: "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 election.17.a: "Splitters!"
 political.1.t: "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d: "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a: "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.1.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for a communist coup."
 political.1.b: "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 political.1.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for a communist uprising."
 political.2.t: "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 political.2.d: "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.2.a: "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 political.2.a.tt: "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t: "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d: "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a: "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t: "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d: "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a: "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t: "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d: "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a: "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t: "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d: "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a: "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 political.6.b: "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 political.7.t: "Fascism on the Rise"
 political.7.d: "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a: "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.7.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for a fascist coup."
 political.7.b: "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.7.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 political.8.t: "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d: "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a: "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t: "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d: "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a: "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t: "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d: "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a: "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b: "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t: "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d: "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a: "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t: "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d: "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a: "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t: "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d: "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.13.a: "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 political.13.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for arranging elections."
 political.13.b: "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 political.13.b.tt: "Increases the chance of people voicing support for democracy and forming an opposition."
 political.14.t: "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d: "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a: "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt: "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t: "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d: "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a: "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t: "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d: "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 political.16.a: "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 political.16.b: "Let the people be heard."
 political.17.t: "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d: "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a: "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b: "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t: "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d: "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a: "Suppress this hateful movement!"
 political.18.b: "Don't pay any attention to them."
 political.18.c: "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 political.19.t: "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d: "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 political.19.a: "Un-[Root.GetAdjective] activities must be stopped!"
 political.19.b: "Ignore them, they're just causing trouble."
 political.19.c: "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 political.20.t: "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 political.20.d: "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 political.20.a: "Round them up."
 political.20.b: "Just proceed as usual."
 political.20.c: "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 political.21.t: "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 political.21.d: "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.21.a: "We will stop them at any cost!"
 political.21.b: "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 political.22.t: "Communists Rise Up"
 political.22.d: "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 political.22.a: "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 political.22.b: "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 political.23.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 political.23.d: "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 political.23.a: "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 political.23.b: "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 political.24.t: "Fascists Ridiculed"
 political.24.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 political.24.a: "What a bunch of clowns."
 political.25.t: "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 political.25.d: "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 political.25.a: "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 political.26.t: "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 political.26.d: "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."

If the war does not end with this, what targets remain? What is left to threaten with?"
 nuke_dropped.7.a: "Does this mean the end of the Japanese Empire?"
 nuke_dropped.7.b: "As long as [From.Owner.GetLeader] lives, so does the Empire."
 nuke_dropped.8.t: "Atomic Bombing of Washington D.C."
 nuke_dropped.8.d: "A nuclear bomb was detonated today over the capital of the United States. In an attack clearly directed at the political center and historical legacy of the US, the White House, the Capitol and a number of monuments and memorials were wiped off the face of the Earth. Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core. No doubt, the US hoped to be the first and only country to wield such a weapon. Those hopes have now been shattered in the worst possible way."
 nuke_dropped.8.a: "One nation, indivisible, versus one atom, divisible."
 nuke_dropped.8.b: "The eagle will rise from the ashes like a phoenix."
 nuke_dropped.9.t: "Atomic Bombing of Rome"
 nuke_dropped.9.d: "A nuclear explosion struck the city of Rome today, shocking people around the world. Due to its historical and artistic treasures, many had never thought the ancient city would be the target of such indiscriminate destruction. With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack. For a while, it looked like the city could aid the nation's recovery after the war was over. Those hopes have now been turned to dust, along with many people."
 nuke_dropped.9.a: "Bomba Iacta Est!"
 nuke_dropped.9.b: "Rome won't be rebuilt in one day..."
 nuke_dropped.10.t: "Atomic Bombing of Paris"
 nuke_dropped.10.d: "Today, a nuclear device was detonated over the city of Paris, causing widespread destruction and countless casualties. France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state. Perhaps the coming decades will see the birth of a new Paris, but Paris in the public mind, the city built in the Belle Époque, is gone forever."
 nuke_dropped.10.a: "The city of light has burned out."
 nuke_dropped.10.b: "Only yesterday, it seemed like we'd always have Paris."
 nuke_dropped.11.t: "Atomic Bombing of Moscow"
 nuke_dropped.11.d: "A city many have tried and failed to conquer, Moscow was the target of a nuclear attack today. The explosion was directed at the heart of [From.Owner.GetAdjective] leadership, the Kremlin having been nearly completely destroyed by the blast.\n\n[From.Owner.GetLeader], having grown more aware and fearful of all possible and impossible threats recently, evacuated in time and survived. However, even the vastness of [From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy. Indeed, if this continues, the nation will soon consist only of two kinds of wastelands: Those which were there in the first place, and those created by its enemies."
 nuke_dropped.11.a: "Won't a nuclear winter only make Moscow a more difficult target?"
 nuke_dropped.11.b: "They may burn every city we have, but they will never take them."
 nuke_dropped.12.t: "Atomic Bombing of Copenhagen"
 nuke_dropped.12.d: "Today, the city of Copenhagen was struck by a nuclear explosion. Having grown after escaping destruction in the Great War thanks to Denmark's neutrality, the capital has never experienced an attack close to this devastating since the Napoleonic Wars. The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of the end for one of Europe's oldest nations."
 nuke_dropped.12.a: "Something is irradiated in the state of Denmark."
 nuke_dropped.12.b: "The city has burned before, but not perished."
 nuke_dropped.12.c: "With plutonium we bring the Danes to their knees!"
 nuke_dropped.13.t: "Atomic Bombing of Stockholm"
 nuke_dropped.13.d: "The beautiful city of Stockholm, proud Venice of the North, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."
 nuke_dropped.13.a: "With this, Swedish neutrality will be but a memory."
 nuke_dropped.13.b: "The Swedish tiger will not lose its stripes!"

While details are scarce, it seems several whole units of the [From.From.GetAdjective] Army have declared for the armed opposition against [From.From.GetLeader] and the [From.From.GetRulingParty] ([From.From.GetRulingIdeology]).

One analyst described the situation like this; \"It's clear that this in reality was a [From.GetAdjective]-backed coup attempt that failed to secure their objectives fast enough, resulting in a tense standoff that degraded into what now looks like a full civil war\". Several world leaders, espacially those with a [From.From.GetRulingIdeology] have had less than diplomatic words for the as of yet unconfirmed [From.GetAdjective] involvement.\n\nWith the two different sides in the conflict represent not only stark differences in domestic, but also international direction, it will be interesting to follow if other countries also get involved in the conflict."

 USA_2016_Recount_News.1.d: "Donald Trump has been confirmed the 45th President of the United States today after an election recount undertaken by Green Party President Jill Stein. Clinton, having conceded the election on November 9th, declined to call for a recount. Despite President-elect Trump's attempt to file legal motions to block the recounts, several other states were subject to recounts separate from Stein's efforts. These included Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida. Despite minor discrepancies, all states certified their original November 8th election results. \n\nWhile Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over three million votes, Trump carried enough swing states to net him a total of 301 electoral votes to Clinton's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South, Midwest, and surprisingly Pennsylvania."

This was enough to carry enough swing states to net Hillary a total of 301 electoral votes to Trump's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South.

Preparations for the 19th National Congress began in 2016 and ended with a plenary session of the Central Committee a few days prior to the Congress. In 2016, local and provincial party organizations began electing delegates to the congress as well as receiving and amending party documents. During the congress, a new guiding ideology, labelled Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, was written into the party's constitution. It marked the first time since Mao Zedong Thought that a living party leader has enshrined into the party constitution an ideology named after himself. The Congress also emphasized strengthening socialism with Chinese characteristics, party-building, and socialist rule of law, and setting concrete timelines for achieving development goals, such as building a moderately prosperous society and achieving "socialist modernization"."

As was the case in Taiwan, all three airports in the province were closed, and ferry service was suspended in preparation for the storm. Likewise, Xiamen Airlines cancelled all scheduled flights.\n\nDespite becoming a weaker storm upon its landfall in China as opposed to its landfall on Taiwan, Bilis caused more fatalities and accrued a greater damage cost in China. Economic losses in China totaled US$534 million, with most of the losses occurring in Fujian Province. A total of 57 people were killed, though an additional 1,077 people were either wounded or went missing. Due to felled trees, a railway line from Fuzhou to Mawei blocked rail service.

The CSSTA will facilitate business between China and Taiwan, as well as promote investment in our country. However, we still need to send this treaty to the legislature in order to be ratified, and the opposition has already expressed suspicions regarding the effects of the treaty on Taiwan and the closed-door nature of the negotiations that produced it. We can either seek to placate these fears through an extended clause-by-clause review process of the treaty or try to rush the treaty through the Legislative Yuan."

The latter issued a strong warning to China, promising swift American action in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nTaiwanese troops have reportedly begun mobilizing in preparation for an even greater escalation, and the government has begun evacuations of Taiwan's outlying islands."
 china.25.a: "War is coming."

 china.26.t: "The Taiwan Special Administrative Region is Established"
 china.26.d: "Following a gradual improvement in relations between mainland China and Taiwan, [TAI.GetLeader]'s government has agreed to rejoin the mainland as a Special Administrative Region in an exchange for a preservation of Taiwan's political and legal autonomy. Politicians from the pro-reunification Pan-Blue Coalition have made statements lauding this move as the beginning of a new, better part of Taiwanese history while their pro-independence Pan-Green counterparts have expressed reservations."
 china.26.d_coup: "Following the pro-Chinese coup in Taiwan, the new "temporary" administration has agreed to rejoin the People's Republic of China as a Special Administrative Region, as an apparent compromise. While opposition to the new administration has been muted, public support for this move is far from clear."
 china.26.d_war: "The victorious Chinese have announced the establish of a Special Administrative Region of Taiwan, trumpeting the move as a sign of China's capacity for compromise and moderation. While the new S.A.R. may eventually have a degree of independence from Chinese rule, in its current state it is in no position to do so."
 china.26.a: "The Chinese civil war has finally come to an end."

 china.27.t: "The NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong"
 china.27.d: "The Basic Law of Hong Kong calls for the Chief Executive to eventually be elected by way of universal suffrage. However, if we implement this electoral system the chances of pro-Beijing figures running the territory will be significantly lower due to the relatively larger popularity of pan-democrat candidates. While we should avoid the possibility of an anti-Chinese or pro-independence figure from becoming Hong Kong's Chief Executive, we should also be careful not to antagonize the Hong Kong people. Might there be a third way out of this predicament?"
 china.27.a: "Universal suffrage is out of the question!"
 china.27.b: "We can accept universal suffrage, as long as we vet the candidates first."
 china.27.c: "The Hong Kong people should choose their leaders."

 china.28.t: "The Future of Hong Kong"
 china.28.d: "We have so far made no indication as to the fate of Hong Kong when the Basic Law preserving its current autonomy expires in 2047. It may be in our interest to do so now as promising a continuation of its autonomy could help convince Taiwan to return to our control. On the other hand, we might want to quash separatism by showing the inevitability of every Chinese territory's return to our control."
 china.28.a: "The S.A.R. will endure."
 china.28.b: "Hong Kong will return to our control."

 china.29.t: "China Joins the World Trade Organization"
 china.29.d: "After a long negotiating process with the existing members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), China has finally achieved a ratification of its application to join the WTO. China has had to demonstrate to the members of the WTO, especially the United States and the European Union, that it is making notable steps towards opening up its economy to competition. Chinese state media hailed this event as "a historic moment in China's reform and opening-up and the process of modernisation"."
 china.29.a: "China continues to open up to the world."

 china.30.t: "China Completes Transition towards Free-Market Economy"
 china.30.d: "Recent liberalizations of the Chinese economy have culminated in a full transition from the "socialist market economy" model to a full-blown free-market economy. Reports indicate that [CHI.GetLeader] had to go to great lengths to convince Communist Party officials and leading figures in Chinese industry that this historic move would benefit everyone. Subsequently, opposition to the move has been muted but many analysts believe that there is significant apprehension among China's rural poor about the new changes."
 china.30.a: "There is nothing holding back China's development now..."

 china.31.t: "[CHI.GetLeader] Denounces Deng Xiaoping"
 china.31.d: "In a dramatic departure from China's decades-old policy of "reform and opening up", [CHI.GetLeader] criticized the "moral decadence and oppression of the rural poor" that Deng's economic reforms brought about. Many observers outside the country have been shocked by this vocal denunciation of someone who has for years been venerated as the architect of Chinese development. Others however, had predicted this outcome due to the gradual strengthening of the leftist faction within the Communist Party.\n\n The implications of this speech for the future of Chinese governance remain to be seen. Some have speculated that the speech is simly a rhetorical device to increase [CHI.GetLeader]'s popularity among the leftist elements in the party, the military and the wider population. Others, however, are convinced that this speech heralds a large-scale reversal of market liberalization."
 china.31.a: "The People's Republic returns to its roots."

 china.32.t: "China Declares the Fifth International"
 china.32.d: "Following China's transformation from Deng Xiaoping's "socialist market economy" model into a full-blown planned economy, [CHI.GetLeader] has announced the creation of a "Fifth International", inviting communist parties from around the globe to participate in this new Chinese-led initiative. This move has provoked concern amongst many foreign governments, who fear the ramifications of China's announcement regarding their domestic politics."
 china.32.a: "Communism is once again a force to be reckoned with..."

 china.33.t: "China Completes the Yarlung Tsangpo Diversion Project"
 china.33.d: "China's efforts to reduce its water scarcity issue have now become a threat to us in the form of the Yarlung Tsangpo Diversion Project. The diversion of the Brahmaputra river, known as Yarlung Tsangpo in China, threatens to deprive thousands of our people of its essential supply of water. Despite the clear negative ramifications of their decision, the Chinese have pressed ahead and in doing so have jeopardized the security of our citizens."
 china.33.a: "The Chinese continue to test our patience..."

 china.34.t: "China Steps up its "Belt and Road Initiative""
 china.34.d: "China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been known to be in the works for the past few years, having undergone a rebranding after "One Belt One Road Strategy" was deemed to be too threatening. [CHI.GetLeader]'s administration today announced its intention to invest in multiple infrastructure projects as part of the BRI in countries around the world. While many developing countries have welcomed the announcement in anticipation of much-needed Chinese investment in their economies, Japan, India, the US and Australia have all expressed reservations about the initiative, viewing it as a veiled attempt to spread Chinese influence overseas."
 china.34.a: "Where do we sign?"
 china.34.b: "We reject this threat to our independence!"

 china.35.t: "The Belt and Road Initiative has reached our shores!"
 china.35.d: "Chinese firms have invested into our key infrastructure! This is providing a welcome boost to our economy and has strengthened the ties between our two nations, although some may say that we should be wary of China's growing influence in our nation."
 china.35.a: "We are grateful to the PRC."

 china.36.t: "China Gains Control of Sri Lankan Port"
 china.36.d: "Over 100 years ago China signed 99 year leases with Germany, France, and the UK yielding up strategic territory to the then dominant European powers. Today it is not China that is signing its own territory away but Sri Lanka, as its Hambantota port, built with Chinese assistance, has incurred huge losses for the government in Colombo. The 99 year lease is ostensibly intended to help Sri Lanka repay its debt to China, but critics have lambasted the deal as a threat to Sri Lankan sovereignty and an attempt to extend Chinese influence in the region in a neo-colonial fashion."
 china.36.a: "China's global reach is growing."
 china.36.b: "Sri Lankan sovereignty has been eroded!"

 china.37.t: "China Expels Foreign Interests"
 china.37.d: "Drawing widespread international condemnation, China has expelled all foreign firms and NGOs from its territory regardless of country of origin. This move follows a number of radical changes in recent months that have seen China take a strong turn towards pure communist governance, most notably a denouncement of Deng Xiaoping and the revival of Mao Zedong thought.\n\n[USA.GetLeader], among other world leaders has lambasted the [CHI.GetLeader] administration for its expulsion of foreign interests as well as the growing harassment of foreign individuals residing in China. China, for its part, has not issued an official response to the complaints of [USA.GetLeader] and others, but has trumpeted the patriotic nature of its actions to domestic audiences through state media."
 china.37.a: "The Chinese have lost their senses!"
 china.37.b: "The Chinese people are once again free from foreign oppression!"


 china.38.t: "China Demands Our Loyalty!"
 china.38.d: "Citing China's historical suzerainty over Vietnam, [CHI.GetLeader] has demanded that we submit to China's authority and yield up control of our foreign policy. This wildly offensive demand violates our state sovereignty as guaranteed by international law. However, can we really afford to antagonize this rising power?"
 china.38.a: "We no longer have to submit to the Chinese!"
 china.38.b: "We must accept this humiliation..."

 china.39.t: "China is Undermining Our International Position!"
 china.39.d: "Our global influence has declined sharply in recent years thanks to the efforts of the Chinese, jeopardizing our position as the world's sole hegemon and laying the foundations for a new world order. Perhaps those who predicted the "End of History" following our victory over the Soviet Union were overly optimistic after all."
 china.39.d_SOV: "Our erstwhile allies have been busy forcing us out of our Central Asian sphere of influence. As China's interference in our domain grows the main reason for our strategic alignment, the threat posed by the United States, pales in comparison. The time for inaction must come to an end if we are to maintain our current position."
 china.39.a: "We must strike now before it is too late!"
 china.39.b: "We are headed towards irrelevancy..."

 china.40.t: "[CHI.GetLeader] Pledges to Hold Elections!"
 china.40.d: "External observers were shocked today to learn that the People's Republic of China will now be holding elections on a local level. While some have lauded the move as a major step forward in terms of Chinese political liberalization, experts have described this sentiment as overly optimistic given the lack of political reform in other areas of government such as the approachs towards political parties and censorship. One analyst stated that these elections "will turn out to be nothing more than a reinforcement and legitimization of Communist Party rule"."
 china.40.a: "The CCP will not give up power that easily..."

 south_china_sea_clash.1.d: "Our gamble has paid off! We have now extended our control over the South China Sea and therefore have greater access to that waterway's multiple benefits. Our adversaries have retreated, but we should be cautious in case they decide to launch a counter-offensive."
 south_china_sea_clash.1.d_loser: "We have lost our strategic territory in the South China Sea to the Chinese! This is a sad day for our nation and our people, and demands a response from our government. Due to China's permanent seat on the UN Security Council, our chances of success if we appeal for foreign intervention are slim. The response must come from ourselves, whether it be in the form of verbal condemnations and protest or an armed assault."

 south_china_sea_clash.7.d: "In an attempt to assert its sovereignty over the South China Sea, China has ordered provocative fleet exercises in international waters. We should consider using our navy to conduct freedom of navigation operations to show to the world that these waters belong to the international community, not to the Chinese."

 south_china_sea_clash.8.d: "In response to our perfectly legal fleet exercises in the South China Sea, the Americans have entered our sovereign waters in an aggressive but pointless move.

 south_china_sea_clash.10.t: "The Fate of the Paracel Islands"
 south_china_sea_clash.10.d: "The Paracel islands hold great strategic value in the South China Sea and give us access to lucrative resource-extraction opportunities.

Dozens of American lives were lost in this incident. America's response to this clash remains to be seen but U.S. President [USA.Getleader] is reportedly considering an armed response.\n\nAnalysts remain divided on whether the unprecedented Chinese reaction to the American naval patrol was due to trigger-happy Chinese naval officers on the ground inadvertently causing a dangerous escalation, or whether these events represent a deliberate effort by Beijing to spark a conflict with America."

 sino_indian.4.t: "China Extends its Influence over Bhutan"
 sino_indian.4.d: "The small nation of Bhutan has seen its independence severely undermined by China's extension of a road into the country's sovereign territory without its consent. Neither Bhutan nor its protector, India, offered up resistance to this move beyond condemning it and reiterating the territory's status as Bhutanese and not Chinese territory. India's failure to protect its neighbor from this act has reportedly severely undermined the historically close relationship between the two countries."
 sino_indian.4.a: "China continues pushing outwards."

 sino_indian.5.t: "China has Disengaged from Bhutan"

 sino_indian.13.t: "China Pivots Towards India"
 sino_indian.13.d: "For decades China and Pakistan have been close strategic partners due to their shared distrust of India. However this has recently started to change, with China giving up its commitment to defend Pakistan as well as ending joint military exercises and investment projects between the two countries. The Chinese are reportedly putting out signals to the Indians that these measures represent a long-term re-orientation of Chinese foreign policy rather than simply a short-term spat.

While many have hailed these exercises as a symptom of successful international cooperation, others have reacted much less enthusiastically to this latest development.

While both [CHI.GetLeader] and [SOV.GetLeader] have remained silent on this power struggle, Russian officials are reportedly furious with the Chinese and bitter about the humiliation of the Slavic giant that has taken place in full view of fellow SCO member states.

 ### Taiwanese Events ###
 taiwan.1.t: "228 Hand-in-Hand rally"
 taiwan.1.d: "A demonstration of solidarity. A human chain was formed with about two million people forming a 500km human chain. Starting at the harbor at Keelung, Taiwanâ€™s northernmost city, the chain wended its way to the southernmost tip of the island. The purpose was dual in nature. The Taiwanese wished for peace, but they were also protesting the deployment of missiles by the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China aimed at Taiwan, their island neighbor. Some of the symbolism of the demonstration, particularly at the point in the event where participants \'turn away from China\' veered clearly toward support of Taiwanese independence, and hence was not attended by members of the Pan-Blue Coalition who countered the demonstration with an island-wide rally of their own days later."
 taiwan.1.a: "Let us never forget the victims"
 taiwan.2.t: "Typhoon Bilis"
 taiwan.2.d: "In preparation for Bilis, offices were closed across the island. In addition to the closure of businesses, flights to and from the island were rescheduled, and a typhoon relief center was established. Due to the threat of landslides, a landslide warning was issued for Taiwan. Though the storm had not yet made landfall, one person was killed in Taipei on August 22 after they were buried by a landslide triggered by the impending typhoon; this accounted for the first fatality caused by Bilis. Along with flight rescheduling, numerous airports were closed, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange was set to close on August 23. Meanwhile, hospitals extended service times in anticipation for patient admittance. Taiwanese coast guard members regulated fishing activity due to the threat of deadly wave action. The Port of Kaohsiung was closed throughout the duration of the storm. Due to the heightened demand for vegetables in the lead-up to the storm, the cost of such foods increased by 20 to 30 percent.\n\nBilis was a highly destructive tropical cyclone for Taiwan. Damage to the island's agricultural, fishing, and forestry industries amounted to US$133.5 million. The typhoon caused 14 fatalities and injured an additional 80 people. Power outages adversely impacted approximately 600,000 households, and 400 homes across Taiwan were destroyed. Several hundred thousand families experienced water shortage following the storm. In Cheng-Kung, a weather station recorded a 281 km/h wind gust, which broke the station's anemometer. A single landslide in the town of Jenai buried nine farmers. Tens of thousands of people were displaced during the storm, and moved into evacuation shelters set up by the government. In eastern Hualien County, 250 houses succumbed to strong winds. The winds also felled trees and blew light vehicles around, blocking roads. Heavy rainfall associated with Bilis flooded roughly 40,000 ha of orchards and rice paddies. Following Bilis' passage of Taiwan, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the island, exacerbating the already worsened conditions."

 taiwan.3.t: "Taiwan presidential election"
 taiwan.3.d: "Its the second ever direct presidential election of the Republic of China, to elect the 10th-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China under the 1947 Constitution. This has the potential to put an end to more than half a century of Kuomintang rule on Taiwan, since the KMT voters split in half.\n\nThough more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, the outspoken former Taiwan Governor James Soong failed to gain the Kuomintang's nomination. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. The Kuomintang responded by expelling Soong and 21 of his allies. They sued Soong for theft, alleging that as party Secretary-General, he stole millions of Taiwan dollars in cash intended for the family of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and hid the money in the Chunghsing Bills Finance Co. Soong defended himself by saying he was acting under Lee's direction, but his story was largely unpersuasive. Initially holding a commanding lead in the polls, Soong lost by just over 300,000 votes, and the financial scandal that tarnished his image as a clean politician will likely led to his failure.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party run former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian for president. Having run for the 1996 election on a radical independence platform and lost by a landslide, the DPP in May 1999 moderated its stance by issuing the "Resolution on the Future of Taiwan." The resolution accepted the status quo and promoted the moderate view that Taiwan was already independent, so any formal declaration would not be urgently necessary, if at all. Also included was the pledge that any change in Taiwan's international status will have to be done through a referendum, thus alleviating the fear that, if elected, a DPP government would unilaterally declare independence without popular approval. The Chen-Lu ticket also promises to be more aggressive in fighting black gold, to provide more funding for social services, and to be more environmentally friendly, such as opposition to nuclear power."

 taiwan.4.d: "The CGA combines the Coast Guard Command, the Marine Police Bureau, and several cutters from the Taiwan Directorate General of Customs, Ministry of Finance. The CGA formally unifies coastal and maritime law enforcement agencies. It will see a great deal of action for a young agency, participating in numerous search and rescue and anti-smuggling operations in the near future.\n\nThe Coast Guard Administration of the Ocean Affairs Council (CGA) is charged with maintaining law and order, protecting the resources of the territorial waters of the ROC, which surrounds Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, Dongsha Islands, and Nansha Islands as well as providing a first line of defense along coastal areas against smugglers and illegal immigrants. The CGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of Ocean Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan, though during emergencies it may be incorporated as part of the Republic of China Armed Forces.\n\nThe Coast Guard Administration is headed by one minister and three deputy ministers. The CGA includes eight departments, one office and five task forces, as well as a Maritime Patrol Directorate General and a Coastal Patrol Directorate General. Its jurisdiction covers the waters surrounding Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu, and the main island of Taiwan to ensure proper protection of the 1,819.8 kilometers coastline and 540,000 square kilometers of "Blue Territory," which is 15 times larger than the island of Taiwan."

Among these departments, Asia-Pacific Industrial and Business Management is especially designed for cultivating industrial elites.\n\nAn unusual feature in this school is its open space. There are no walls on the boundaries of the campus. Residents who live around this school can walk to campus or exercise by using equipment in the gym. Biodiversity is also a notable characteristic of NUK. There are more than 60 sorts of fish in pond of the Water Land Park."

 taiwan.8.d: "Following its approval by the Taiwanese legislature, the CSSTA, a free-trade agreement between Taiwan and mainland China, has officially entered Taiwanese law. This agreement marks a serious improvement in relations between the two parties, and will sigificantly improve cross-strait trade in services.

 taiwan.10.d: "[CHI.GetLeader]'s government has offered us a "Roadmap to Reunification" mapping out a path for Taiwan to eventually return to Chinese control as a Special Administrative Region. The proposal includes multiple safeguards for the continuation of Taiwanese democracy and political autonomy, but this may not be enough for Taiwanese opponents to reunification with the mainland. How China might respond if we reject this plan remains uncertain."
 taiwan.10.a: "We should accept the plan."
 taiwan.10.b: "Taiwan is not China!"
 taiwan.11.t: "Reports of Suspicious Chinese Intelligence Activity"
 taiwan.11.d: "Our intelligence services are reporting heightened activity by Chinese agents on our territory.

 taiwan.12.d: "A faction of Taiwanese military officers have started seizing key locations across the island of Taiwan. [TAI.Getleader] has declared a national emergency and has mobilized those who remain loyal to the government. It remains to be seen whether the President's efforts will be successful.\n\nWhile the stated aim of the leaders of the coup is to address dissatisfaction with the [TAI.GetLeader] administration, many of the high-profile figures involved have close ties to China. Despite this, the extent of China's involvement in this coup attempt remains unclear."
 taiwan.12.a: "Taiwan's future hangs in the balance."
 taiwan.13.t: "The Taiwanese Coup has Succeeded"
 taiwan.13.d: "Following [TAI.Getleader]'s failed attempt to rally support against the coup, military officers loyal to the pro-Chinese faction in Taiwan have taken control of the country. While the officers have promised an eventual return to democracy, Taiwan's political autonomy from the mainland is undoubtedly in jeopardy. With China's unspoken but widely known support for the coup, the likelihood of a Security Council Resolution in response to this event is highly improbably."
 taiwan.13.a: "A new era in Taiwanese history."
 taiwan.14.t: "The Taiwanese Coup has Failed"
 taiwan.14.d: "[TAI.Getleader] emerged triumphant today as the last participants in the coup surrendered to Taiwanese police. The last 2 weeks saw a failure by the coup-plotters to win the support of the people or their fellow soldiers. This lack of support contributed to existing deficiencies in resources and morale, leading to pro-coup troops around the country surrendering to the authorities en masse. [TAI.Getleader] assured journalists that stability and calm would quickly be restored to the island nation, while China has yet to comment on recent events."
 taiwan.14.a: "Crisis has been averted."
 taiwan.14.b: "Our efforts have proved fruitless."
 taiwan.15.t: "China Demands an End to the Taiwan Relations Act!"
 taiwan.15.d: "The PRC has demanded that we revoke the Taiwan Relations Act that enshrines our current relationship with the governing authorities of Taiwan. This demand is undoubtedly a prelude to even more aggressive action towards Taiwan than what we have already seen in recent months.

 taiwan.18.d: "With the stated aim of frustrating Chinese attempts to interfere in Taiwan's electoral process, [TAI.GetLeader] has managed to pass a controversial "anti-infiltration bill" in parliament. The bill bans hostile foreign powers from campaigning, lobbying, making political donations or spreading disinformation. Opposition lawmakers have strongly opposed the bill as has Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office. Both lambasted [TAI.GetLeader] as perpetrating a "Green Terror" that contributes to an atmosphere of paranoia and fear. [TAI.GetLeader]'s ruling party has defended the move as a necessary act given the substantial threat that mainland China poses to the island territory."

 hongkong.1.d: "Following China's decision to rule out the possibility of Hong Kong electing its chief executive by universal suffrage, mass protests have broken out in the Chinese territory. [HKG.GetLeader] has stated that while the Hong Kong government respects the right of the Hong Kong people to peacefully and legally express their views, violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated. China's response to the current crisis remains to be seen, as [CHI.GetLeader] has not commented on recent events."
 hongkong.1.d_limit: "Following China's decision that the Chief Executive of Hong Kong could only be elected by universal suffrage if it pre-approves the candidates, mass protests have broken out in the Chinese territory.

 hongkong.2.t: "China Deploys Troops to Hong Kong"
 hongkong.2.d: "Following protests in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, China has ordered multiple units from the People's Liberation Army to take to the streets of Hong Kong to "restore law and order". [CHI.GetLeader] has assured "peaceful demonstrators" that they will not be targeted and all those who are arrested will be treated in accordance with international human rights law. However, many in Hong Kong and abroad have expressed scepticism regarding the extent to which Chinese troops will exercise restraint towards demonstrators."
 hongkong.2.a: "This action is despicable!"

 hongkong.2.c: "This is none of our business."

 hongkong.9.t: "Hong Kong Protests Fizzle Out"
 hongkong.9.d: "Protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region against recent Chinese actions have gradually declined in recent days and have virtually come to a stop. Police operations in the Chinese territory have met with no resistance, and many who had previously taken to the streets have returned to their homes. What this means for the relationship between China and a troubled territory that holds significant different political values from the former remain to be seen. Perhaps one indicator for what is to come was a banner left by protestors in a prominent location in the city center which read "We will be back"."
 hongkong.9.a: "An interesting development."
 hongkong.9.b: "They know their cause is futile."

 hongkong.10.t: "Hong Kong Protests Increase in Scale"
 hongkong.10.d: "Protests against Chinese actions in the territory of Hong Kong have rapidly increased, with analysts widely agreeing that the protests have entered a new stage in terms of scale and tactics. How the Chinese and Hong Kong governments will respond to this new escalation remains to be seen, but officials in both governments are reportedly increasingly resentful of the impacts of the protests on their vested interests. The protestors, for their part, are refusing to stand down until the Chinese and Hong Kong governments address their demands."

#Korea
 korea.1.t: "China Demands Our Withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula"
 korea.1.d: "The PRC has demanded that we withdraw our troops protecting the Republic of Korea from what it describes as its "sphere of influence". This demand is undoubtedly a prelude to aggressive action towards the ROK. If we pull our troops out of the Peninsula, the chances of a conflict across the DMZ will rise dramatically."
 korea.1.a: "This demand is ludicrous!"
 korea.1.b: "It is better for us to concede..."

 korea.2.t: "China is encouraging us to initiate economic reforms"
 korea.2.d: "[CHI.GetLeader] is urging our government to follow China's lead and initiate market liberalization reforms. While experiencing the same rapid economic growth as China did in the 1980s is a tempting proposition, we should weigh this against the instability that would inevitably result from our pursuit of such reforms."
 korea.2.a: "Now is not the time for reform!"
 korea.2.b: "Initiate minor reforms."
 korea.2.c: "Initiate moderate reforms."
 korea.2.e: "Initiate major reforms."

 korea.3.t: "[NKO.GetLeader] has announced fresh economic reforms"
 korea.3.d: "Under Chinese pressure to reform, North Korea has begun a process of economic liberalization that many hope will raise living standards in the "hermit kingdom". While many economists have lauded the beginning of this reform process, others have raised concerns about whether the speed of reform may cause instability in a country that has become adjusted to a completely planned economy."
 korea.3.a: "Encouraging news?"

 korea.4.t: "The Chinese-North Korean Split"
 korea.4.d: "Criticisms of [NKO.GetLeader]'s regime in Chinese government-linked media have increased dramatically in recent weeks. These criticisms have attacked North Korea's continued nuclear problem and the North Korean state's failure to improve the livelihoods of its citizens through economic liberalization as China has done in recent decades.\n\nWhile [CHI.GetLeader] has remained silent on the issue, it is widely believed that these media organizations would not have launched such a scathing critique of a once close ally without [CHI.GetLeader]'s tacit approval. Many observers see this as a culmination of Chinese frustration with the Kim dynasty, and possibly a desire for the establishment of an alternative government that is more stable and compliant with China's wishes."
 korea.4.a: "Only [CHI.GetLeader] knows where this going..."

 korea.5.t: "The Talks Begin"
 korea.5.d: "The primary demand of the North is that we cease our joint military exercises with the United States, exercises that they see as preparations for an invasion of their territory. However, these exercises are widely viewed by our military as necessary preparations in case of a North Korean attack. Agreeing to stop these exercises would therefore be a significant gamble, one where our country's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.d_NKO: "The primary demand of the South is that we cease our nuclear weapons tests, tests that they see as evidence of our aggressive intentions. However, our nuclear weapons program is viewed by the military as an important deterrent against US invasion. Moreover, the program and the tests that are necessary for its continuation help bolster the legitimacy of our government. Agreeing to stop these tests would therefore be a significant gamble, one where both our country and our government's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.a: "Our country will never be whole again unless we take a few risks..."
 korea.5.b: "Some risks are too big too take."

 korea.6.t: "Korean Peace Talks Held in Beijing"
 korea.6.d: "For over half a century North and South Korea have technically been in a state of war. This frozen conflict has occasionally heated up with clashes between the two sides along disputed maritime boundaries or across the DMZ. Now China is taking the initiative to bring about an end to this state of affairs and achieve de-escalation on the Korean peninsula through a formal peace treaty. Such an agreement would necessarily consider the ROK's joint exercises with the United States and the DPRK's nuclear weapons tests in order to be successful."
 korea.6.a: "Can the two sides reach a compromise?"

 korea.7.t: "Korean Peace Talks a Success!"
 korea.7.d: "With both sides agreeing to make significant concessions, the talks held in Beijing have resulted in the signing of a peace treaty between representatives of North and South Korea. [CHI.GetLeader] praised both sides for their commitment to peace, and reassured the Korean people that the wounds that they have suffered over the years are beginning to heal."
 korea.7.a: "An encouraging development!"

However, since the invasion of Iraq, the country has been mainly dominated by various Shia groups, which has led many of the Kurds (who are mainly Sunni) feeling left out.\n\nThe rise of ISIS has allowed Kurdistan to increase its influence. After the collapse of the Iraqi Army in 2014 left Northern Iraq under ISIS control, the Kurds quickly stepped in claim territory from ISIS, including Kirkuk, the cultural capital of Iraq.\n\nDue to the waning power of ISIS, we finally have the opportunity to hold an independence referendum for Kurdistan"

 Kurdistan.3.b: "Use this as leverage for autonomy"
 Kurdistan.4.t: "Kurdistan Demands Independence"
 Kurdistan.4.d: "Due to the success of the Kurdish Independence Referendum, the Kurdish government is trying to use the referendum as leverage to declare full independence. It seems that they aren't happy with just limited autonomy, and they still hold Kirku, which is rightfully part of Iraq."

 Kurdistan.9.b: "Beg for forgiveness"
 Kurdistan.10.t: "Kurdistan Declares Independence"
 Kurdistan.10.d: "The Kurdish government announced today that Kurdistan is an independent country, and not part of Iraq.

 #News
 KurdistanNews.1.t: "Kurdistan Rejoins Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.1.d: "During the apex of ISIS, Kurdistan started slowly shifting away from Iraq and becoming more independent. Now that ISIS has been defeated, the Kurdistan Regional Government seems to have made a full turn and expressed wishes to start working again together with the Iraqi federal government. Many speculated that the Kurds would be aiming for independence, but it seems they've decided to decide otherwise, possibly fearing repercussions from their neighbours."
 KurdistanNews.1.a: "Interesting"
 KurdistanNews.2.t: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum"
 KurdistanNews.2.d: "The Kurdish Regional Government has announced that it will be holding an independence referendum in the areas that they currently control. The move has been called controversial, due to the referendum being held in areas that aren't officially part of the Kurdish Autonomous Region but the Federal State of Iraq, including the major city of Kirkuk.\n\nMany see this as nothing more than a landgrab by the Kurds, while others argue that the Kurds have earned their right to independence after practically saving Iraq from ISIS. Even though the KRG claims that the results will be non-binding, many fear that it will lead to a full independence, and possibly a new conflict in Iraq."

As the Iraqi forces approached Kirkuk, most elements of the Peshmerga retreated from the city without a fight. Some independent elements of the Kurdish forces stayed and tried to set up a defence of the city, but were quickly overwhelmed by the Iraqis. In just two days, the Iraqi forces had regained full control of the city, most of it without any fighting."

 KurdistanNews.7.t: "Kurdistan Defends Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.7.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier.

At the same time, the Popular Mobilisation Forces attacked in the centre towards Kirkuk Airfield. As the 9th Armoured Division got bogged down in the suburbs, the Kurdish forces managed to conduct a flanking attack against the PMF forces, forcing them to retreat. With the centre destroyed, the separated elements of the 9th Armoured Division were soon forced to retreat as well.

 #Yemeni Events

 Yemen.4.t: "The War in Yemen has Ended"
 Yemen.4.d: "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missiles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region with the help of the Saudi coalition and it's campaign, Restoring Hope, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being rebuilt."
 Yemen.4.d2: "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibility of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of rebuilding the country. The Saudi coalition has withdrawn from the region, and has rendered Operation Restoring Hope, a complete and utter failure."
 Yemen.4.d3: "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The Saudi coalition and Operation Restoring Hope has been a complete failure, and it's incompetence has failed to predict it's own defeat to an enemy it never new was this serious. The Jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realize what this new caliphate can do."
 Yemen.4.a: "Victory is finally ours..."
 Yemen.4.b: "But at what cost?"
 Yemen.4.c: "It could have been worse..."
 Yemen.4.e: "Interesting."
 Yemen.4.f: "Interesting."

 Yemen.6.t: "Fire missile at Riyadh?"
 Yemen.6.d: "Shooting a missile at the Saudi Capital will show the saudi's we're a force to be reckoned with."
 Yemen.6.a: "Do it!"
 Yemen.6.b: "Too dangerous"

 Yemen.7.t: "Houthis fire ballistic missile at Riyadh"
 Yemen.7.d: "Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Houthi rebels says it has intercepted a missile fired from the neighbouring country towards the kingdom's capital, Riyadh. Houthi rebels said on Tuesday they had launched a ballistic missile targeting al-Yamama royal palace to mark 1,000 days since the coalition started its bombing campaign in Yemen."
 Yemen.7.a: "Uh oh"

 Saleh.1.t: "The Houthi Power Struggle"
 Saleh.1.d: "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was concieved. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a: "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b: "Get President Saleh on the phone..."

 Saleh.2.t: "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d: "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a: "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b: "It couldn't hurt..."

 Saleh.3.t: "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d: "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a: "Well then, gather the coalition."
 Saleh.3.b: "This probably isn't a good idea..."

 Saleh.5.t: "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d: "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publically declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a: "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b: "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."

 Saleh.6.t: "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d: "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a: "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b: "Let him go..."

 Saleh.7.t: "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d: "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot forsee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a: "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it"
 Saleh.7.b: "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together"

 Saleh.8.t: "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d: "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a: "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b: "Forget it..."

 Saleh.9.t: "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d: "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a: "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b: "Ali, stop this immediately, or else"
 Saleh.9.c: "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"

 HOU_Saleh.1: "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2: "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3: "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 HOU_Saleh.4: "Ali is disappointed."
 HOU_Saleh.5: "Ali will be contacted once more."
 HOU_Saleh.6: "Ali visibly recoils, and exits the room."
 HOU_Saleh.7: "Ali will be contacted again, but let this be the final warning to him that if he remains aligned with our enemy, he too will be treated as an enemy."

 Saleh.10.t: "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d: "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a: "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b: "This is pointless..."

 Saleh.11.t: "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d: "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a: "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"

 Saleh.12.t: "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d: "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
 Saleh.12.a: "Good work boys."
 Saleh.12.b: "This is troubling..."
 Saleh.12.c: "Interesting."

 Saleh.13.t: "Saleh Renews GPC-Houthi Alliance"
 Saleh.13.d: "The leader of the General People's Congress, a long-time Houthi ally, though not on the greatest of terms, has declared a renewal of the once divided alliance. Ali Abdullah Saleh publically announced a new chapter in Yemen's future, a chapter in which the GPC and Houthis will work together to restore the ruined nation. Saleh gave one condition, and that was that the Houthi leadership formalizes the Supreme Political Council, an interim government put in place in the time of war, and split the rulership between the two alliances, as was originally planned."
 Saleh.13.a: "Is this good? I can't tell."
 Saleh.13.b: "Damn!"

 Saleh.14.t: "The Coalition Gathers"
 Saleh.14.d: "The Houthi leadership opposing the democratic, Hadi-led government in Yemen, has shown that they are willing to come to the table and talk about the humanitarian situation currently ongoing in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition operating in Yemen, has invited all of it's members to a diplomatic summit being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The special guests will be Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi himself, along with his associate, Ali Abdullah Saleh."
 Saleh.14.a: "We must attend."
 Saleh.14.b: "Sorry, we don't have time for this."
 Saleh.14.c: "We would be honoured to host this summit."

 Saleh.15.t: "The Summit Commences"
 Saleh.15.d: "Those that chose to attend that summit take their seats, and await the beginning of the discussion. The Houthis have mentioned that they are not coming into this discussion with the intent to just surrender, so we must sway them to see the conflict from an outsider's shoes. This war in Yemen has been one of the greatest humanitarian crises in recent memory, and it would benefit all parties for the war to be put to a halt as soon as possible. To make this quick, let us share our demands..."
 Saleh.15.a: "Surrender and return all territories to Yemen's rightful government."
 Saleh.15.b: "Cease the conflict immediately, and both states shall remain independent."
 Saleh.15.c: "All Houthi claimed land shall be declared an Arabian state."

 Saleh.16.t: "The Coalition Demands Surrender"
 Saleh.16.d: "We were invited to this summit in Abu Dhabi to discuss a potential end to the war we have been fighting for years now, and we have come to the realization that this was all a waste of time. We were immediately greeted by an absurd demand as soon as the summit had started, that demand being our full surrender. But, as long as the war still rages, people will continue to die and cities will continue to be destroyed. Ending the war may be for the better, but it would mean capitulating to our sworn enemies."
 Saleh.16.a: "This war must end, so we must oblige."
 Saleh.16.b: "Ridiculous! This discussion ends now!"

 Saleh.17.t: "The Coalition Demands both States Remain Independent"
 Saleh.17.d: ""
 Saleh.17.a: "All of Yemen is ours, or this discussion is over."
 Saleh.17.b: ""

 CentralAfricaNews.1.CAR.d: "The legitimate government of [CAR.GetNameDef] under [CAR.GetLeader] has managed to pacify the fringes of the country.\n\nAfter being cornered in the capital as the rest of the country fell under various militias and factions, with international support the government was able to eventually expand the rule of law back into the country. Even though the worst violence is behind them, the government will still have to work hard to remove all sectarian violence from the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.SEL.d: "The Seleka coalition in Central Africa has secured control of the country.\n\nThe origins of the group is in 2003, when it was formed to combat Michael Bozize's coup. After the Seleka leader Michel Djotodia was made president in 2013, the group was officially disbanded. This caused the ex-fighters to go on a reign of terror in the country, igniting the civil war.\n\nDespite being predominantly Muslim (thus representing only a tenth of the population), the group still has managed to once again gain control of the country. This will most likely create another wave of terror on the predominantly Christian population of the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.BAL.d: "The Anti-Balaka allince in Central Africa has gained control of the country.\n\nWhat started as a Christian militia to protect from highwaymen in the 90s, turned into an official self-protection group in 2009. The group's main purpose became to fight against the Seleka militias, who were predominantly Muslim. Like their enemies, they quickly adopted violent tactics, force converting, burning and mass executing Muslims in the country.\n\nThe group is now in full control of the country, and future prospects for the small Muslim minority are looking bleak."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.LOG.d: "The Republic of Dar El Kuti, also known as Republic of Logone, has subjugated the Central African government and the various militias roaming the country.\n\nCalling for independence for the Muslims of the country, Dar El Kuti has practically split the country in two. This might only be a short period for peace however, as many Christians still live in the new republic's borders."

This greatly upset the non-secular leadership of Al-Shabaab.\n\nDespite being driven to near defeat in 2017, the Islamist group managed to bounce back and gather support from various smaller Islamist and tribal factions, many of which were displeased with the Western-backed secular government. The Black Standard now flies over Mogadishu, and the Al-Shabaab are free to continue spreading radical Islam"
 SomaliaNews.0.a: "Horrible"
 SomaliaNews.0.b: "Allahu Akbar!"
 SomaliaNews.1.t: "Al-Shabaab Defeated!"
 SomaliaNews.1.d: "The Somalian governmental forces have managed to capture the last remaining stronghold of the Islamist Al-Shabaab. Ever since the ignition of sectarian violence in 2009, the Somalian government along with its African Union allies have been fighting Al-Shabaab. Already a cornered animal by 2017, the last remaining pockets of Al-Shabaab were slowly but surely destroyed by Somalian and AMISOM forces.\n\n'Small pockets of resistance and individual terror cells still remain but they will not be a threat to the Somali government', a government spokesperson said."

 SomaliaNews.1.b: "The martyrs will be avenged!"
 SomaliaNews.2.t: "Somalian Civil War Over"

 SomaliaNews.2.SNA.d: "The Somali National Alliance has managed to claim rulership over Somalia against the UN-backed Transitional National Government. [SNA.GetLeader], son of late general Mohammed Aidid, has been nominated the new president of the Republic. The fight between SNA and TNG originated from SNA's claims that the TNG was 'harboring militant Islamist sympathizers'. The new government will likely clamp down hard on the more radical elements of Somali society."
 SomaliaNews.2.Separatist.d: "The nation of Somalia delves into chaos, as various separatist groups claim victory over the government. Despite Somalia being an ethnically homogeneous country, clan traditions still rule strong and offer a stronger sense of identity than nationality.

 brazil.14.d: "Nearly five hundred years ago the Portuguese first set foot on our shores. They were greeted by the locals with somewhat open arms in an land vast and plenty. However, now they are excluded if not removed from public life. The 500th Anniversary of Brazil in 2000 was a vicious and violent day. Brazilian MP officers used brute force to disperse an native demonstration, dubbed the 'March of the Excluded.' It did nothing more than to even further isolate the natives from the government more so than it had already been."

 Denmark.2.t: "Major Victory Predicted for [DEN.GetAdjective] Conservatives"
 Denmark.2.d: "The [DEN.GetAdjective] Conservatives seem to have made a triumphant comeback after having been in decline since the beginning of the 90's. When asked about the reason for this turn of events, one political commentator remarked that the international cultural exchanges of the new millennium seems to have left many Danes adrift without a sense of belonging anywhere and have made Danish values a centrepoint of political discourse. Conservative leadership is already gearing up to capitalize on this newfound support with speeches underlining their unwavering defense of 'all that makes us [DEN.GetAdjective]'."
 Denmark.2.a: "Back to the 80's"
 Denmark.3.t: "Surprising Monarchist Developments in [DEN.GetName]"
 Denmark.3.d: "[DEN.GetName] has been a constitutional monarchy since 1849 and the role of the monarch has ever since then been largely ceremonial in nature. However, a new monarchist movement calling for a larger degree of political autonomy for the [DEN.GetAdjective] monarch is rapidly gaining traction in the public. So far the Queen herself has not made any public comments on the matter, but political commentators have pointed out that with her educational background, having studied political science and a variety of academic fields at Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, she would theoretically be a competent actor on the political stage."
 Denmark.3.a: "Oh Daisy!"

 diplomatic_response.2.t: "[From.GetName] rejects!"
 diplomatic_response.2.d: "After several nights and bitter fights over minor details and major points, the most recent wave of negotiations between the [This.GetName] and [From.GetName] delegations have failed. Our proposal will not come to fruition any time soon."
 diplomatic_response.2.o1: "Oh well."
 diplomatic_response.3.t: "[From.GetName] folds!"
 diplomatic_response.3.d: "Unsurprisingly, the [From.GetAdjective] delegations were soon convinced of our overwhelming might and folded to our demands. We got what we wanted."
 diplomatic_response.3.o1: "Excellent!"
 diplomatic_response.4.t: "[From.GetName] defies us!"
 diplomatic_response.4.d: "We knew that some [From.GetAdjective] people are idiots, but their top envoys had to join the rank of idiots in the last few days of negotiations. They defied us, rejected our demands and sent our envoys home.\n\nThese fools."

 #Egypt
 Egypt.1.t: "el-Kosheh Massacre"
 Egypt.1.d: "The el-Kosheh Massacre was a terrorist attack that occurred on Sunday, January 2 in the village el-Kosheh in Upper Egypt, 450 kilometers south of Cairo.\n\nThe Coptic Christian minority living in North Eastern Africa has always had a difficult relationship with radical Muslims living among the Islamic majority populations. el-Kosheh was a local economic center in Sohag governorate with a population of about 35,000 and a majority Coptic population - a fact that did not save the local civilians from militant attackers. After a religious conflict between a Christian shop owner and a Muslim customer, the Muslim community of the village was outraged into a frenzy and began looting and pillaging Christian shops and storefronts, mainly in the outskirts of the city in el-Kosheh village, a good distance away from the city of Kosheh.\n\nThis massacre was one of the largest in Egypt's history and calls the efficiency of our majority-Muslim government into action. The pope of the Coptic church has already called this a tragedy of martyrdom and declared the 21 massacred Christian martyrs. What should the government of Egypt do?"
 Egypt.1.a: "We will track these bastards down."
 Egypt.1.b: "The Christians need to shut up."

 #Ethiopia
 ethiopia.1.t: "Ethiopian Loan Requests"
 ethiopia.1.d: "The Ethiopian government's attempts to get the national economy back on track through the invitation of international companies and the strengthening of local and regional economic sectors with the usage of government investments.\n\nNow, Ethiopia has approached our ministry of finance with a request to grant further government loans to the Ethiopian industrial and economic development sector. It seems as if we have little to gain for our government, but our businesspeople are warning us that if we don't grant loans to Ethiopia, somebody else will. And if our businesses are rejected due to our hostile stance towards the country, somebody else's companies are sure to get accepted."
 ethiopia.1.a: "We shall grant additional loans."
 ethiopia.1.b: "We cannot share anything at this time."
 ethiopia.2.t: "Ethiopia seeks Investments"
 ethiopia.2.d: "Ethiopia's industrial sector has recently experienced a massive boom that the government of [ETH.GetLeader] is now looking to expand upon.

 ethiopia.5.t: "The African Alliance"
 ethiopia.5.d: "It was Ethiopia whose flag defined the colors of the Pan-African movement due to our prolonged resistance against European colonialism. It was Ethiopia shaping generations of young black Africans both inside and outside our borders to be strong and proud African nationalists. It was Ethiopia that followed the doctrine of unity in diversity across the African continent.\n\nBut unity and diversity are no longer enough. The European colonial powers of old are eyeing greedily at their former African possessions, aiming to once again carve out economic spheres of interest for their mega-corporations. Chinese investments from the far east are both a blessing and a curse, as China aims to establish itself as an equal to the great powers of old. The United States has long abandoned her doctrine of freedom and liberty in favor of a doctrine of oil and money.\n\nAfrica needs to stand together and unite under the flag of one common military alliance to resist both American and Russian, both Chinese and Indian ambitions to form military blocs.\n\nWe shall send invitations to all eligible African Union members. Except for Eritrea. We will conveniently forget Eritrea."
 ethiopia.5.a: "For Africa! For Humanity!"
 ethiopia.6.t: "Invitation to the African Alliance"
 ethiopia.6.d: "In daring defiance to European and East Asian diplomatic influence, the Ethiopian government aims to reform the African Union into a complete military bloc. We are eligible to join due to the fact that we are an African Union member not already entangled in another alliance.\n\nBut should we surrender our sovereignity and neutrality in favor of the African Alliance? Or is the African Alliance our key to sovereignity and neutrality in the first place?"
 ethiopia.6.a: "Africa stands as one!"
 ethiopia.6.b: "Oh, I don't think so."
 ethiopia.7.t: "Addis Ababa Light Rail finished"
 ethiopia.7.d: "The Addis Ababa Light Rail finally finished its construction phase and were now going on to the testing. The Light Rail was originally intendet to have a total of 41 stations on its two lines (of which 39 were finished) and each train has a capacity to carry 286 passengers. This will enable the light rail transit to provide a transportation service to 15,000 passengers per hour per direction and 60,000 in all four directions while the fares cost 2-6 Ethiopian birr.\n\nThe railway was contracted by the China Railway Group Limited and it is operated by the Shenzhen Metro Group.

 ethiopia.7.a: "Finally no more traffic jam's!"
 ethiopia.8.t: "Ethio-Djibouti Railways stops its operations"
 ethiopia.8.d: "After World War II, the railway began a long period of decline. Traffic on the railway dropped in half from 1953 to 1957, as road transport began to compete for cargo. The Ogaden War of 1977–1978 dealt a further blow to the railway, as Somali troops invaded us and captured the railway as far as Dire Dawa. Portions of the railway were blown up in the war, and railway operations were again cut in half. After the war ended, the railway continued to decline from a lack of maintenance and attacks from rebels such as the Ogaden Liberation Front.\n\nBoth the lack of maintenance and an ambitious road construction program made rail transport increasingly non-competitive. In January 1985, the Awash rail disaster killed 429 passengers when their train derailed on the Awash River Bridge and fell into the gorge below. Railway service finally ended this year between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, but trains continued to run between Dire Dawa and Djibouti. The tracks between Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa fell into total disrepair, and many of the rails were stolen and sold for scrap."
 ethiopia.8.a: "We should have repaired it earlier"
 ethiopia.9.t: "Addis Ababa Light Rail expanded"
 ethiopia.9.d: "The new line built is completely grade-separated. Apart from extending the existing lines, two new lines were built. The first one start at St. George's Cathedral, pass along Mexico Square to the African Union Headquarters and terminate at Lebu, connecting to the new national rail network. The second line start at Megenagna Roundabout and passes via Bole Airport, Wello Sefer area, Saris market area and Jommo area and terminates at Lebu."

 ethiopia.12.a: "They will need more to stop us!"
 ethiopia.13.t: "Isayas Afewerki arrested"
 ethiopia.13.d: "As soon as Eritreas last stronghold fell we found Isayas Afewerki and his most loyal men while they tried to escape to neighboring Sudan. His bodyguards put up a good fight but the numbers wasnt on there side and so Isayas found itself soon on the way to Addis Ababa where he will await his trial.\n\nTill then he is put under house arrest."
 ethiopia.13.a: "Put him under house arrest"
 ethiopia.14.t: "Trial of Isaya Afewerki"
 ethiopia.14.d: "Today is the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaya Afewerki. Under loud protest by himself he is brought into the court chamber and accuse the court of corruption and an unjustly trial under the point that his sentence is already decided. Many international reporters share this point but this wont save him today.\n\nAnyways, after 3500 Birr the judges agreed to our decision which will be...?"

 ethiopia.14.b: "Life imprisonment should do it"
 ethiopia.15.t: "Trial of Isaya Afewerki"
 ethiopia.15.d: "Today was the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaya Afewerki.

 ethiopia.16.d: "Today was the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaya Afewerki. The sitting was long, but at the end of the day the decision was made, Isaya will face the death sentence.\n\nThis sentence wasnt made since 1998, when an Eritrean businessman gunned down an popular Ethiopian general and thus is quite special.\n\nAlmost immediately after the judgement was made, armed police officers escorted him out of the hall where he faced his sentence."
 ethiopia.16.a: "He was a bad guy"
 ethiopia.17.t: "Local police station attacked by ELPF"
 ethiopia.17.d: "In the middle of the day three trucks stopped in front of the police station and armed men opened instantly fire upon the poor officers in the building.\n\nNone of them survived and the weapon safe was plundered. The armed men escaped as soon as they were coming.\n\nLater that day the ELPF uploaded a video where they claim the responsibility for that attack."

 european_union.1.o2: "Veto!"
 european_union.2.t: "We have been vetoed!"

 european_union.4.d: "The European Union in the past has done everything to drive its member states closer to each other. It guaranteed us peace, economic prosperity and greater freedom for our citizens. But now, the EU is asking us to do the next step: One of the countries has initiated the process to Unite the EU."
 european_union.4.o1: "In varietate concordia!"
 european_union.4.o2: "Give up our sovereignity? Rather not."
 european_union.5.t: "Invitation to the European Union"
 european_union.5.d: "Due to recent bureaucratic reforms within the European Union, it now views us as a valid partner. One of the major European powers has called for us to join the economic alliance. Our people are split on the issue and our decision could go either way."
 european_union.5.o1: "In varietate concordia!"
 european_union.5.o2: "This is not our goal right now."
 european_union.6.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Investments"
 european_union.6.d: "The deal behind the European Union is simple: Larger European economies help the smaller ones develop and, in exchange, gain a larger market and a greater amount of possible consumers.

 european_union.10.d2: "The European Union holds us and our fellow sovereign European states back from greatness. The members of our government grow increasingly upset with the European attitude towards our national sovereignity and the ease with which European delegates do whatever the United States tells them to do.\n\nWe need to quit. This is unacceptable. They can kiss American asses all they want, but they will have to do that without us."
 european_union.10.d3: "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of. This however has lead to a precarious spot for us, being asked to either hold general elections within the next week or be expelled from the halls.\n\nWell, we won't hold elections, that much is certain, so it seems they will have to play their little 'democracy' game without us."
 european_union.10.d4: "With a right-wing political party now in power, the democratic character and economic benefit of the European Union has been increasingly called into question.\n\nThe [This.GetRulingParty] delegates are split on the issue: The ideological hardliners want to leave the union no matter the consequences, while the economically liberal faction points to the number of jobs created by the EU and the political stability it brings to the continent.\n\nAny decision will be controversial, as the populous is split on the issue. Will the EU carry on without us - or should we stay?"
 european_union.10.d5: "The European Union is nothing but a bunch of capitalists that try to conquer the world for capitalism. Our brave [This.GetAdjective] delegates have stood up for the working people in every session they attended, but they are outvoted on almost any issue - when asking to disown the super rich across Europe, the delegation was even kicked from the hall! Well, maybe they should not have attacked three other delegations while their speaker was trying to argue with them, but still!\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. We can no longer carry this farce of a conglomerate. Without us!"
 european_union.10.d6: "Even [This.GetLeader] has remarked that the European Union is really 'nothing but a bunch of infidels' when talking to a conservative islamic newspaper last week. Because of this, calls to leave the EU have gotten louder the country over - and inside the European Union. 'If you don't respect our holy halls, leave!', the president of the European Parliament shouted at our delegation today. After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation. We are thankful for their cooperation, but their hedonism and worldly intrigue is unacceptable. They will have to play their stupid games without us."

 european_union.10.o2: "Maybe we should stay after all."
 european_union.15.t: "The End of the European Union"

What should our policy be?"
 european_union.16.o1: "An excellent proposal!"
 european_union.16.o2: "We want an opt-out."
 european_union.17.t: "Re-Nationalize the Currency"
 european_union.17.d: "Now that we are no longer involved with the Eurozone, we have - as expected - been informed by the European Central Bank that we need to soon shift the Euro out of use in our country.\n\nIntroducing a new national currency will take quite a bit of political effort - but it has to be done."
 european_union.17.o1: "Let's get it over with."
 european_union.18.t: "Call EU military aid?"
 european_union.18.d: "We are under attack by a foreign power. As according to the EU article 42.7 - the 'mutual defense clause' - we are entitled to military assistance from all other European Union members. Should we invoke the article to call our friends to our side?"
 european_union.18.o1: "Call the EU to our side!"

 #Finland
 Finland.1.t: "Conscription Reform"
 Finland.1.d: "The Finnish military has held strong onto its conscription laws even after the main threat to Finnish sovereignity, the Soviet Union, stopped to exist. Nowadays, Finnish conscription laws seems archaic, with men and women not being treated equally under who gets to serve or not to serve in civilian or military service at how long or at what punishment when refusing to serve.\n\nSome argue that conscription should be abolished and that both the money and the freed up workforce could then profit the civilian economy. More conservative thinkers point to the Russian Federation as 'the Soviet Union but less red', with a possible Russian willingness to re-establish global ambition posing a very real threat to Finnish independence."
 Finland.1.a: "The Status Quo is satisfactory."
 Finland.1.b: "Conscription is costly and useless. Abolish it."
 Finland.1.c: "Every man and woman a soldier!"
 Finland.2.t: "Timber Export Policy"
 Finland.2.d: "Timber is one of Finland's most important natural resources. Finnish trees are of high quality and internationally rather desired - but is our current policy regarding the speed of woodcutting realistic?"
 Finland.2.a: "Maximize Production."
 Finland.2.b: "A long-term approach is more viable."
 Finland.3.t: "Expansion of the Financial Ministry"
 Finland.3.d: "The Valtiovarainministeriö, the Finnish ministry of finance, is always a significant part of the political debate. How should the budgetary commissions function? How will the state employees be paid? How is the government's economic and financial policy to be shaped and is the chosen way valid?"
 Finland.3.a: "Investment is the way!"
 Finland.3.b: "A hands-off approach is preferable."
 Finland.4.t: "Economic Doctrine"
 Finland.4.d: "The new millennium will be a very stressful time for Finnish business and enterprise, and the government of Finland needs to properly prepare a long-term strategy in order to secure employment and prosperity in the country."
 Finland.4.a: "Keeping Finnish money in Finland is preferable."
 Finland.4.b: "Trading with the EU is the answer."
 Finland.5.t: "Foreign Policy Doctrine"
 Finland.5.d: "Finland has always been in a precarious spot on the world map, trapped between Russia on one side and nations that want to stay away from Russia on the other. Finnish foreign policy is not just a game of well-dressed men in ball rooms, it is a question of national survival. Finland is not to become the chessboard of a NATO advance into Russia and it is also not to become a Russian oblast either."
 Finland.5.a: "The world is in balance and the balance needs to be kept."
 Finland.5.b: "The government needs to hire additional diplomats."
 Finland.6.t: "Military Policy"
 Finland.6.d: "The prospect of Russian invasion is one of the defining policy points of Finnish politics. Our ministry of defense, the Puolustusministeriö, is in charge of actually keeping our nation alive (unlike many other similar government agencies) and needs to be given solid pointers regarding the question where to go."
 Finland.6.a: "The army is most important."
 Finland.6.b: "Let's experiment."
 Finland.7.t: "The Finnish Monarchy"
 Finland.7.d: "Frederik Kaarle I is the Finnish name of Friedrich Karl, the German prince from Hesse-Kassel that almost became King of Finland in 1918. His descendants were rather reluctant to step forward when our government published plans to establish a German monarchy friendly to the imperial government in Berlin - primarily because of how unpopular the idea is in the Finnish public.\n\nFinally, Donatus Philipp Umberto, the great-grandson of Friedrich Karl but also a great-grandson of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, has stepped forward and presented himself as an option to the Finnish government.\n\nHe will do fine. But his role is yet to be determined."
 Finland.7.a: "He needs to lead Finland!"
 Finland.7.b: "He shall be our constitutional monarch."
 Finland.8.t: "Finland offers CSTO Membership - at a price"
 Finland.8.d: "Finland had, over the past few years and especially the last few months, voluntarily approached Russia in friendship and assistance, and while Finnish-Russian friendship clubs were formed in St Petersburg and Helsinki, it seems like the Finns have different plans.\n\nThey want their former territory back. In exchange for the restoration of the 1938 border between Finland and the then Russian Republic inside the USSR, Finland offers to join the CSTO military alliance.\n\nSuch an offer is an insult to Russian nationalism, but a military prospect that might be worth considering. But can Finland be trusted?"
 Finland.8.a: "We accept."
 Finland.8.b: "We laugh in their face."
 Finland.9.t: "Finland offers Mutual Defensive Agreement"
 Finland.9.d: "Both Finland and Sweden are connected in their attempts to stay neutral. The Finnish government has approached us with an offer to formalize our mutual interests and our binational relationship through a two-way guarantee of independence. That is a great idea: It's an alliance, but not really, but really."
 Finland.9.a: "Good idea!"
 Finland.9.b: "No, thanks."

 Germany.1.t: "Krater von Wattenscheid"
 Germany.1.d: "The city of Bochum is a historical coal mining town that, since the decline of the coal industry, has turned into a vibrating and modern city that is an integral part of the Ruhr Area.\n\nHowever, nasty reminders of the coal legacies can come up - especially when former underground coal mines suddenly collapse, revealing sizable destructive craters. One of these events happened on January 2nd, 2000, in Bochum-Höntrop."
 Germany.1.a: "The city can deal with it."
 Germany.1.b: "A good time for industrial safety legislation!"
 Germany.2.t: "N24"
 Germany.2.d: "On January 24th, 2000, the news-focussed television channel "N24" was launched into public broadcasting.\n\nN24 is inspired by American news channels like Fox News and CNN, but refuses a political allegiance akin to the ones that American channels usually have. However, due to the fact that N24 is part of the ProSiebenSat1 Group, it is unlikely that this channel will help non-establishment parties with its political sections."
 Germany.2.a: "Good."
 Germany.3.t: "Klaus-Peter Sabotta"
 Germany.3.d: "In a series of attempted terror attacks against German railroads between 1998 and 1999, former railway worker Klaus-Peter Sabotta tried to protest changing work conditions and his drift into unemployment.\n\nOn February 4th, the final verdict regarding Sabotta, condemning him to life imprisonment."

 Germany.5.t: "Golzheim attack"
 Germany.5.d: "On October 2nd, 2000, the synagogue and Jewish community center in Golzheim (part of Düsseldorf) was attacked in an act of arson by two young Arabs.\n\nThe attack caused widespread disgust and signs of solidarity with the Jewish community that especially showed themselves in renewed acts of holocaust remembrance and pro-Jewish charity collections - much to the dismay of Germany's far-right factions."
 Germany.5.a: "We will never surrender to terrorists!"
 Germany.5.b: "Eh, the Jew can protect himself."
 Germany.6.t: "Ten years of German unity"
 Germany.6.d: "When the Berlin Wall fell on November 11th, 1989, every German on either side of it knew that the nation would thoroughly change.\n\nWest and East Germany were united on October 3rd, 1990, now ten years ago. Has the united Germany been a success so far?"

 Japan.3.a: "Atarashī Tennŝ Heika!"
 Japan.8.t: "China is Demanding the Senkaku Islands!"
 Japan.8.d: "China has revived their dispute with us over ownership of the Senkaku islands. If we give in to their demands we might increase China's confidence in its ability to influence our foreign policy as well as reduce our popularity among the more nationalistic of our people. However, the consequences of refusing probably do not bode well for us either."
 Japan.8.a: "Let them have their fishing rights..."
 Japan.8.b: "Japan will not be intimidated!"
 Japan.4.t: "Japan has Handed Over the Islands!"
 Japan.4.d: "Clearly accepting the legitimacy of our claim, Japan has returned the Diaoyu islands to us, their rightful owner."

 Japan.6.d: "Our fighters regularly respond to Chinese incursions into our air space, normally without incident. However this time our fighters were fired upon by the Chinese, resulting in the deaths of several of our pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. We should evaluate whether this incident, given China's recent actions, was a deliberate provocation or an unfortunate accident and decide our response accordingly."
 Japan.6.a: "We have a right to self-defense!"
 Japan.6.b: "We should call upon our protectors!"
 Japan.6.c: "This was probably an accident..."
 Japan.7.t: "Chinese and Japanese Fighter Jets Engage in Aerial Combat"
 Japan.7.d: "The East China Sea has erupted into conflict following a confrontation between Chinese and Japanese aircraft. The clash reportedly began when Japanese jets were scrambled to intercept Chinese fighters over Japanese airspace. Rather than resulting in a Chinese retreat which has historically occurred after similar incidents, Japanese aircraft were fired upon, resulting in the deaths of several Japanese pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. [JAP.GetLeader] has strongly condemned the incident and is reportedly engaged in urgent talks behind closed doors regarding Japan's response to this event."
 Japan.7.a: "Is a third Sino-Japanese War on the horizon?"

 India.1.d: "India Airlines Flight 814 (commonly known as IC 814) had been en route from Kathmandu, Nepal to Delhi, India on December 24th, 1999, when it was hijacked.\n\nThe hijackers took control of the airplane shortly after it left Nepali airspace and entered Indian sovereign territory. The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatizing and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparantly belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages. All of them - except for the man that had been murdered - were brought back to India in relatively good physical health."
 India.1.a: "A shameful victory is still a victory."
 India.1.b: "We will need to implement air safety reforms."

 #Libya
 LibyaNews.1.t: "Second Libyan Civil War Comes to an End"
 LibyaNews.1.GNA.d: "The Second Libyan Civil War started in 2014, after the Libyan military under General Khalifa Haftar ousted the ruling government when they refused to step down after losing the elections of 2014. The supporters of the government formed a new faction, the National Salvation Government, sparking a new civil war. In 2015, the UN brokered a truce between the two factions, forming a new joint-government called the Government of National Accord. However, only a year later the peace was shattered, plunging the country into a three-way civil war.\n\nIt seems that the internationally backed Government of National Accord has managed to overcome the rebellious factions and unite the country, despite lacking the backing of the Libyan military. Being recognized by the EU and much of the Western world, this is a vast shift of balance in the region."

Supplied and backed by Russia, Haftar has promised land for two Russian military bases in the country. This will see an increase of Russian influence in North Africa."

Who those actors were remains unclear."

 Norway.2.o1: "Intriguing."

Others unfortunate enough to be captured by the rebels were promptly gunned down and paraded through the streets of Freetown.\n\nSeveral days of looting has occurred after the fall of the government, as rebels across the country celebrate their victory.\n\nThe country will most likely fall to anarchy and chaos as the militias no longer have any other enemies apart from the local populace."

 SierraLeone.2.d: "The Government of Sierra Leone has fallen to the rebels. It seems that our intervention wasn't enough to save them.

 LiberiaNews.1.LIB.d: "Today Charles Taylor, the dictator-president of Liberia, announced the end of LURD in Liberia. Despite the Liberian military being in shambles, and most of the work being done by Taylor's anti-terrorist units, LURD with their Guinean allies weren't able to topple his government.

Shortly after, he boarded a plane to fly into exile into Nigeria, as LURD rebels danced all along the streets of Monrovia. Due to suspected war crimes, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for  Taylor. However, the Nigerian government has refused to deport Taylor, unless the request comes from the new Liberian government itself.\n\nThe new Liberian government is still in an on-going reorganisation, and it will take time until it establishes itself in Monrovia, and then in the rest of the country."

It is not known what is the fate of Kiir himself.\n\nMachar will most likely align his country closely with that of Sudan, as there are several reports that large portion of his equipment came from the Sudanese Norinco arms manufacturer."

 ###United Kingdom Events ###
 United_Kingdom.1.t: "Falklands Policy"
 United_Kingdom.1.d: "The Falkland Islands have been a point of contention between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina for decades, with Argentina formally laying claim to the island archipelago (as well as neighboring South Georgia) in 1833.\n\nThe Falklands were first colonized by France in 1764 with a settlement on the eastern island, which was joined by a British settlement on the western one in 1766. However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Mavlinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta. There is really no reason why they should be Argentinian, but having a country that owes Britain a favor could be good in the long run..."
 United_Kingdom.1.a: "Over our dead bodies, old chap! Now, where is my tea?"
 United_Kingdom.1.b: "We should turn over the islands to Argentina."
 United_Kingdom_News.1.t: "Britain cedes the Falkland Islands"

The Argentinians had laid claim to the Falklands in 1833, to South Georgia in 1927 and the South Sandwich Islands in 1936.\n\nThe Argentinian government was overjoyed, promising a new age of Argentine-British relations."

 ###Switzerland###
 switzerland.2.t: "End of the Swiss Political System"
 switzerland.2.d: "The democracy in Switzerland, once viewed as a role model and a shining star of inspiration for all those seeking more popular involvement in government due to the possibilities given to the Swiss citizens, is no more.\n\nThe Swiss leader [SWI.GetLeader] has announced that these \"Distractions from Public Life\" and \"Unnecessary Referendums\" would stop taking place."
 switzerland.2.o1: "Good riddance."
 switzerland.2.o2: "Such a shame."
 switzerland.2.o3: "Whatever."
 switzerland.3.t: "Invitation to the Swiss Alliance"
 switzerland.3.d: "In order to protect our mutual international sovereignty, Switzerland has invited us to their alliance of neutrality and multinational safety."
 switzerland.3.o1: "We accept!"
 switzerland.3.o2: "No!"
 switzerland.4.t: "The Alpine Republic"
 switzerland.4.d: "Switzerland has proclaimed the union of Alpine states into the Alpine Republic - and has asked us to join."
 switzerland.4.o1: "For the Alps!"
 switzerland.4.o2: "Uhh, no."
 switzerland.5.t: "Swiss Threats"
 switzerland.5.d: "With a new military faction at their backs, the Swiss have now descended upon us and sent our country a threat to 'stop posing a threat to the Swiss government, people and the countries and peoples allied with Switzerland'. Switzerland also transmitted to us a program of twenty-one points to follow - but accepting would de facto result in our annexation into the Swiss Confederation."
 switzerland.5.o1: "We have to accept."
 switzerland.5.o2: "Never! FREEDOM!"
 switzerland.6.t: "The End of Switzerland"
 switzerland.6.d: "Now confirmed by referendum: The Swiss state will cease to exist. The German and Romansh parts of the country will seek statehood in the Federal Republic, the Romagne will seek accession to France and the Italian parts of Switzerland will become an Italian province."
 switzerland.6.o1: "All good things must come to an end."
 switzerland.7.t: "Adolf Ogi becomes President"
 switzerland.7.d: "The President of Switzerland is a position that switches between the seven members of the Swiss Federal Councils in annual cycles.\n\nAdolf Ogi of the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party took over the position for the year 2000. He had already presided over the council successfully in 1993."
 switzerland.7.o1: "A good choice."
 switzerland_news.1.t: "Switzerland joins the UN"
 switzerland_news.1.d: "Originally, the Swiss government had refused to join the United Nations after the end of the Second World War, pointing to the country's continued dedication to its own neutrality - which is especially weird considering the UN's main seat in Europe is the UNOG, the United Nations Office in Geneva.\n\nNow, after a public referendum on the matter, the Swiss government has announced that the country would move forward to abandon its post as a spectator and would now join the organization as a full member."
 switzerland_news.1.o1: "It's about time, Switzerland!"
 switzerland_news.1.o2: "And what about us?"
 switzerland_news.1.o3: "Is it really that big of a deal?"
 switzerland_news.2.t: "The End of Swiss Neutrality"
 switzerland_news.2.d: "Switzerland's commitment to international neutrality and non-alignment in times of both peace and war goes back to the year 1516, when the Swiss Confederacy stopped its policy of expansion after a defeat at French hands. Swiss secession from the Holy Roman Empire in 1648 helped the country further that stance. The final step was in 1815, when all major powers acknowledged and guaranteed Swiss neutrality in the post-Napoleonic Congress of Vienna.\n\nThis era of Swiss history is now over. The president of the federal council, [SWI.GetLeader], has announced that Switzerland would no longer continue to honor its oaths of old and has formally absolved the major powers previously guaranteeing its independence off their duty to do so."
 switzerland_news.2.o1: "A significant development?"
 switzerland_news.2.o2: "The dawn of a new age!"
 switzerland_news.3.t: "[SWI.GetLeader] confirms Swiss Neutrality"
 switzerland_news.3.d: "The Swiss federal council, backed up by the parliament and the cantons, has today once again affirmed Swiss non-intervention in international conflicts.\n\n[SWI.GetLeader] has commented that membership in an international coalition will not only bring peril to the Swiss people but also encouraged the world to do the same."
 switzerland_news.3.o1: "That's not really news..."
 switzerland_news.3.o2: "Switzerland saving the day!"
 switzerland_news.4.t: "The Swiss Protection League"
 switzerland_news.4.d: "In a move creating a political union that is very close to a military faction (but of course officially not a military faction), the Swiss defensive ministry has gotten parliamentary support for the creation of a 'Swiss Protection League' (which has, as is custom in Switzerland, four different official names in the various languages of the country).\n\nThis seems to be the next big step in further armed 'neutrality' of Switzerland."
 switzerland_news.4.o1: "Armed Neutrality indeed."
 switzerland_news.5.t: "The Alpine Republic"
 switzerland_news.5.d: "The Swiss government has sent requests to the governments of Liechtenstein and Austria to approve of legislation to join the Swiss Confederation in the form of 20 new cantons.\nAt the same time, Switzerland has also officially changed its name to 'The Republic of the Alps' or 'Alpine Republic' for short.\n\nVaduz and Vienna are yet to respond, but chances for unification seem surprisingly good. Liechtenstein has been guaranteed the right to preserve its monarch as permanent head of the canton even in the Republican form of government and Austria has been guaranteed 49% of the seats in the new parliament, with 45% going to the four national communities of Switzerland and 6% to Liechtenstein."
 switzerland_news.5.o1: "Redefining neutrality since 1516."
 switzerland_news.6.t: "The End of the Swiss Confederation"
 switzerland_news.6.d: "In a world shattering referendum, the cantons of Switzerland have all unanimously voted to divide Switzerland among linguistic lines into three entities, a German-Romansh, a French and an Italian one. All of those entities have further already confirmed plans to be absorbed into the respective linguistic motherland.\n\nThis marks the end of Swiss Independence. The country has existed without interruption since the legendary Rütlischwur of 1307."

The plan seems to be comprehensive and be able to save most of the jobs that are threatened by Canadian Airlines possibly going bankrupt - the takeover, to be agreed upon on January 4th, 2000, is to go into effect on January 1st, 2001."

 ###Canadian Political Events
 ##The Clarity Act
 canada_md_politics.1.t: "The Clarity Act"
 canada_md_politics.1.d: "One issue brought up with the 1995 Quebec referendum was that the federalists won by less than a percent. Sovereigntists in Quebec began challenging the close defeat they suffered, but this brought on many questions regarding how secession is supposed to work in the first place. Later, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that no province can unilaterally secede Canada under domestic and international law. They also suggested that a clear majority is indeed required for succession without explicitly mentioning the number of votes required to reach that goal.\n Regardless, the questions were answered. The government has now put forward legislation which states the federal government can examine the clarity of a referendum question, consider any question not solely referring to independence as unclear, and decide if a clear majority has been reached after a referendum has concluded. Furthermore, all provinces and indigenous groups must be part of succession negotiations, the federal government can override a referendum result which violates the contents of this bill, and that a constitutional amendment is required for succession to take place. All these points make succession harder to achieve than ever, but nobody can argue that they do not make sense."
 canada_md_politics.1.a: "Hopefully the Sovereigntists drop their act when this is passed."
 canada_md_politics.1.b: "We have no right to impose legislation like this on Quebec."
 ##OP Yellow Ribbion
 canada_md_politics.2.t: "Operation Yellow Ribbon"
 canada_md_politics.2.d: "A coordinated attack appears to have been made on the World Trade Center in New York City. Other threats may still be looming in the air, and this has resulted in the United States closing its airspace. We must follow their lead to prevent further attacks on potential targets. Transport Canada and Nav Canada will activate their emergency measures to ground all aircraft flying over both American airspace and our own. Pilots will need to land at the closest possible airfields excluding those near large urban areas. Each aircraft must be screened upon landing, and thousands of passengers have to get through customs. Support from the public is necessary to provide food and shelter to everyone left stranded. This is sure to be a massive undertaking."
 canada_md_politics.2.a: "United We Stand"
 canada_md_politics.2.b: "Send the USA Everything we Can Spare!"
 ##Softwood Lumber Dispute
 canada_md_politics.3.t: "Another Softwood Lumber Dispute"
 canada_md_politics.3.d: "Here we go again with a fourth dispute over softwood lumber. The United States has picked yet another fight over it. Our provincial governments are unfairly subsidizing our lumber industry according to them. Timber is owned by the provinces, so they set the prices. Our markets operate somewhat differently from what the Americans are used to. In any case, they have laws allowing them to set tariffs on us to “even the playing field” as they call it. We can probably put an end to this nonsense once and for all by bringing in the World Trade Organization. However, that carries the risk of angering the Americans and causing this issue to go beyond just lumber."
 canada_md_politics.3.a: "Contacting the World Trade Organization will lead to an easy win."
 canada_md_politics.3.b: "We can try for new deal with them rather than start a trade war."
 ##Ontario Goes Dark
 canada_md_politics.4.t: "Ontario Goes Dark"
 canada_md_politics.4.d: "It would appear that 10 million Ontarians and 45 million Americans have lost power. This is looking like the second most widespread blackout in world history if our numbers add up correctly. However, we have to put statistics aside for now. Cities from Windsor to Ottawa need support. Toronto in particular is struggling with all the public transportation in the city put to a halt. Premier Ernie Eves has issued a state of emergency, and we can expect help to arrive in the affected areas soon. Thankfully, some upstanding citizens have already taken on the responsibility of directing traffic and getting people to safety until police arrive. We are working with the United States to investigate what happened, but the cause remains unclear at the moment."
 canada_md_politics.4.a: "It was the Americans"
 canada_md_politics.4.b: "We Really Need to Improve our Infrastructure"
 #The Sponsorship Scandal
 canada_md_politics.5.t: "The Sponsorship Scandal"
 canada_md_politics.5.d: "In 1996, the Liberals began a sponsorship program which promoted the Canadian government’s contributions to Quebec’s industries to counter sovereigntist sentiments. However, it would seem that the money was not being put to good use. Auditor General Sheila Fraser just finished a report on the program, and it has been revealed to the nation that almost half of the $250 million program was spent on corporations friendly to the Liberals. Some of the money would even end up donated back to the Liberals for use in election campaigns. Prime Minister Paul Martin is doing everything he can to reduce the hit his party’s popularity will take, but it appears that the next election might already be decided."
 canada_md_politics.5.a: "We can reach a settlement and enact legislation to ban programs like these."
 canada_md_politics.5.b: "Liberals always seem to find themselves in some kind of scandal."
 #American Nuclear Submarines in the Northwest Passage
 canada_md_politics.6.t: "American Nuclear Submarines in the Northwest Passage"
 canada_md_politics.6.d: "The USS Charlotte has reportedly arrived in Virginia after taking a northern route from Pearl Harbor. Usually, the US Navy is not a concern to us. However, the route this submarine took cuts straight through the Northwest Passage. We see this region as part of our internal waters, but the United States does not share this opinion. This presents a problem that will only continue to grow in the future. More nations will want to use the Northwest Passage as a shipping route as it becomes easier to navigate. Our northern rivals such as Russia may also feel like they have free access to our northern waters. This must come to an end."
 canada_md_politics.6.a: "The presence of foreign states in our territorial waters will not be tolerated."
 canada_md_politics.6.b: "We will let it go."
 #The Toronto 18
 canada_md_politics.7.t: "The Toronto 18"
 canada_md_politics.7.d: "A horrid terrorist plot has just been uncovered in the Greater Toronto Area. Counter-terrorism raids have arrested 14 adults and 4 youths who have been dubbed the Toronto 18. All of them are accused of planning coordinated attacks across Southern Ontario. These attacks would have involved bombing cultural landmarks, opening fire on crowds in the streets of Toronto, taking out power grids, invading the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, storming the headquarters of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and even launching an assault on Parliament Hill. Perhaps most disturbing was their goal of beheading the Prime Minister and other politicians on live television. We always remind the public to never fall victim to fear. However, the possibility of an attack like this being even remotely possible is frightening."
 canada_md_politics.7.a: "Strip these heartless monsters of their citizenship"
 canada_md_politics.7.b: "Our actions in the Middle East might lead to catastrophe here at home."
 #Operation Medusa Commences
 canada_md_politics.8.t: "Operation Medusa Commences"
 canada_md_politics.8.d: "The struggle for Kandahar Province continues in Afghanistan, and we are about to lead the largest land battle ever undertaken in NATO’s history. We enter this fight with our Afghan, American, British, Danish, and Dutch allies. This operation will surely be successful, but our troops must remain cautious against the Taliban. Opposing us are thousands of militants prepared to die for this land. It is unlikely that we will be able to completely push them out of the region so soon. This has many Canadians worried about the casualties our side may suffer in this conflict. After all, the death toll can only rise from here. How smoothly this operation goes will affect the public’s perception of the war."
 canada_md_politics.8.a: "We have to finish this fight, and that means eliminating the Taliban."
 canada_md_politics.8.b: "There will only be more Canadian blood on our hands from here."
 #Quebecois Nation Motion
 canada_md_politics.9.t: "Quebecois Nation Motion"
 canada_md_politics.9.d: "Prime Minister Stephen Harper has put forward a motion in the House of Commons regarding Quebec. It calls for the House of Commons to recognize that the Quebecois form a distinct society within Canada. Each party seems to be showing a large amount of support for this motion, but the Canadian public is divided down the middle. Some say that this only serves to revive separatist sentiments, and that Quebec does not deserve special treatment. Others see this as a positive step forward in Canada’s relationship with Quebec by recognizing the things that make their province unique. In any case, motions in the House have no real effect on the law regardless of the outcome."
 canada_md_politics.9.a: "Canada is indivisible, and Quebec is like any other province."
 canada_md_politics.9.b: "Quebec must have their differences recognized and respected."
 #Indigenous Day of Action
 canada_md_politics.10.t: "Indigenous Day of Action"
 canada_md_politics.10.d: "Canadian First Nations across the country have become increasingly disillusioned with their relationship to the federal government. Today, they have marked the first national day of protest to bring attention to the issues they face. Major transportation routes in many major cities have been blockaded. The activists there are calling for action on issues with land claims, the quality of life on reservations, and social service programs available to them. One of their most pressing concerns is the cancellation of the Kelowna Accord by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It was a series of agreements between the federal government and indigenous peoples which sought to improve education, employment, and living conditions through government-sponsored programs. The accord was not legally binding, but this is a step back for indigenous relations regardless."
 canada_md_politics.10.a: "Bring back the Kelowna Accord and commit to it this time."
 canada_md_politics.10.b: "These people should just accept that the world has changed."
 #RCMP Raid on Conservative Headquarters
 canada_md_politics.11.t: "RCMP Raid on Conservative Headquarters"
 canada_md_politics.11.d: "The Conservatives have been accused of illegally surpassing the number of funding parties are allowed to use on advertising during the last election. Some loopholes were found in the laws on how transactions must be done between different organizations in a party, and the Conservatives used them to funnel lots of money into local advertisements that were not national in scope. Elections Canada is normally supposed to refund some of a party’s expenses in each riding based on the votes they received, but they withheld this due to the scandal. Today, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided the Conservative headquarters in search of documents pertaining to the illegal funding. Both the Liberals and NDP are now using this as an opportunity to attack corruption brought on by the Conservatives."
 canada_md_politics.11.a: "Settle things with Elections Canada quickly to get this out of the public eye."
 canada_md_politics.11.b: "There is no way we can win the next election at this rate."
 #End of the Great Recession in Canada
 canada_md_politics.12.t: "The Great Recession is Over!"
 canada_md_politics.12.d: "We were one of the last industrialized nations to enter a recession, but now we are one of the first to get out. This can be attributed to our strong banking sector and an economic focus on resources rather than services. We also lack the consumer debt issues faced by the United States. Speaking of the Americans, we are now in a very strong position compared to them economically. Their economy collapsed from within while our own was only hurt through our trade relationship. We now have a fantastic opportunity to promote our businesses due to a strong dollar and a falling unemployment rate. How exactly we should proceed is still a question to be answered though"
 canada_md_politics.12.a:  "Push American Markets while they are down!"
 canada_md_politics.12.b:  "Promote Local Business"
 #The Golden Goal
 canada_md_politics.13.t: "The Golden Goal
 canada_md_politics.13.d: "It is the closing day of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and all eyes were set on the final event. The Canadian men’s hockey team had made it to the finals. Only the United States stood in the way of gold. Canada had a strong start at a 2-0 score, but the Americans managed to even the odds with 25 seconds left in the third period. The entire stadium grew tense as sudden death began. Eventually, Jarome Iginla made a pass to Sidney Crosby who then scored the game-winning goal. Cities across Canada immediately erupted with cheering as if the entire nation had come together as one."

 canada_md_politics.13.b: "Wasted Money"
 #G20 Riots in Toronto
 canada_md_politics.14.t: "G20 Summit Riots"
 canada_md_politics.14.d: "The G20 convened in Toronto for the first summit of 2010, and everything was meant to go smoothly. Canada recovered swiftly from the global financial crisis, and this led us to some great opportunities during the meetings. However, there was a massive problem outside the venue. G20 summits seem to attract the attention of many political activists. All the world’s most influential leaders are gathered in one place, and this is a chance for them to have their voices heard. Thousands showed up on the streets to peacefully protest against a perceived lack of transparency and care for public opinion. Rioters among them took advantage of the large crowds to vandalize buildings, loot shops, and set some vehicles ablaze. Many riot police were sent out to put an end to the anarchy, but a lack of leadership lead to some violent clashes involving innocent bystanders. Over a thousand people were detained, and that number makes this the largest mass arrest in Canadian history."
 canada_md_politics.14.a: "Embarrassing"
 canada_md_politics.14.b: "It Could've Been Worse Without Our Security"
 #Wuthdrawing the Securiy Council Bid
 canada_md_politics.15.t: "Withdrawing the Security Council Bid"
 canada_md_politics.15.d: "Canada was a founding member of the United Nations, and continues to be one of the most involved. This involvement once included a record of winning every single bid made for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Our record just got shattered. The first round saw Germany demolish us in votes, and the second had us lose to Portugal. We decided to withdraw at this point, and Portugal’s membership was confirmed in the third round. Many Canadians are upset with this loss, and blame it on the Conservative administration’s foreign policy. Lately, Canada has been intervening much more than usual on the world stage alongside NATO allies. We have followed the US in particular into many battles on foreign soil. Perhaps we must change our approach"
 canada_md_politics.15.a: "We are only defending our values for a safer world"
 canada_md_politics.15.b: "This is an attack on our reputation!"
 #An Orange Wave
 canada_md_politics.16.t: "An Orange Wave"
 canada_md_politics.16.d: "Recent polls for the upcoming election suggest that the NDP have gained more support than the Liberals. Their party has been in third place since its inception, but now it seems to be within reach of forming a government. Jack Layton, their charismatic leader, can be credited with this. He is a champion of progressive causes, and has made his biggest push for Prime Minister yet. Many NDP candidates are veteran politicians from other parties who have been moved by his vision. Canadians across the country have been showing widespread support for his platform as well. This could be the first government in Canadian history to not be formed by Conservatives or Liberals."
 canada_md_politics.16.a: "Ignore these hopefuls. Focus on the real competition!"
 canada_md_politics.16.b: "We must act before Layton takes power!"
 #war of 1812 Bicentennial
 canada_md_politics.17.t: "War of 1812 Bicentennial"
 canada_md_politics.17.d: "Today marks two hundred years since the United States declared war on the British Empire. It was a war that helped shape Canada’s national identity, and the current Conservative administration under Harper is doing everything it can to remind Canadians of that. Millions of dollars have been spent over the past three years to create commemorative coins, historical reenactments, and promotional videos. Not many can argue that teaching youth about our past is a bad thing, but the high cost of the bicentennial compared to similar events has raised eyebrows."
 canada_md_politics.17.a: "Everyone will know the Canadians who defended our freedom"
 canada_md_politics.17.b: "The war wasn't even worth it."
 #International Space Expedition 35
 canada_md_politics.18.t: "International Space Station Expedition 35"
 canada_md_politics.18.d: "Colonel Chris Hadfield has returned from the International Space Station. He was the first astronaut with the Canadian Space Agency to be put in command of the station. Not only is he highly accomplished but he also attracted a massive social media presence. Hadfield often streamed videos to children across the nation to show them what life in space is like. Sometimes he would host online sessions where the internet could ask him anything. He even created a music video on the ISS of him singing Space Oddity by David Bowie. Now he is preparing to publish an autobiography recounting  his experiences in space due later this year."
 canada_md_politics.18.a: "Award him all the nation’s honors for his service, and get us a copy of that book"

 canada_md_politics.19.t: "Negotiations with the European Union on CETA Conclude"
 canada_md_politics.19.d: "Our efforts to diversify the list of our trade partners has resulted in many new free trade opportunities. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade agreement with the European Union might be our biggest trade deal yet. Our markets will open to 28 nations when this is ratified. However, the deal is not without controversy. There are growing concerns to do with the terms on intellectual property laws, genetically modified organisms, and visa restrictions between the two signatories. Newfoundland and Labrador in particular is upset with the way the enforcement of our exclusive economic zone will be altered. Some rules which protected fisheries in the maritimes are now being dropped to appease the Europeans, and this stings after we had fought Turbot War against them in 1994. Nonetheless, we managed a good deal overall considering the economic powerhouse that the European Union is."
 canada_md_politics.19.a: "Open our nation to European investment"

 #Terror in the Capital
 canada_md_politics.20.t: "Terror in the Capital"
 canada_md_politics.20.d: "Ottawa is currently under lockdown after a lone gunman attempted an attack on the government. It began with him fatally wounding a sentry named Corporal Nathan Cirilo at the National War Memorial. He then made his way to the Parliament, and entered the Centre Block through the main entrance under the Peace Tower. Many Members of Parliament were holding meetings at the time, and were gathered in rooms that the gunman happened to run past. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was in one of these rooms, and was forced to hide in a closet as his fellow party members grabbed flagpoles to defend themselves. The gunman shot some rounds as he made his way through the halls, and one bullet flew into the room the NDP were gathered in. Eventually, the RCMP managed to corner the gunman behind a column. Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers dove past the gunman while firing at him, and Constable Curtis Barrett reportedly shot the fatal bullet. Already, news stations around the world have begun sensationalizing this event with reports of the city being under siege. Even calmer reporters are questioning the lack of security on Parliament Hill. Perhaps the Americans were right to increase surveillance as much as they did after facing terror attacks of their own"

 canada_md_politics.20.b: "We must protect Canadians even if it comes at the cost of some freedoms."
 #Airstrikes in Syria and Iraq
 canada_md_politics.21.t: "Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria"
 canada_md_politics.21.d: "The Liberals have just won an election with the promise of ending our airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. What they want to do instead is put more effort into training our allies on the ground to build a more effective fighting force. One reason for this move is that it will save costs, as we have already spent hundreds of millions on our combat operations. Another is that Canadians would not have to put their lives at risk if local forces were able to handle their own battles. There is some merit to both these arguments, but we risk upsetting our NATO allies. Other nations might get the impression that we are making them do all the heavy lifting."
 canada_md_politics.21.a: "We must remain committed to our allies"
 canada_md_politics.21.b: "There are better ways to support the fight against the Islamic State"
 #The Case of Omar Khadr
 canada_md_politics.22.t: "The Case of Omar Khadr"
 canada_md_politics.22.d: "Omar Khadr has become quite a divisive figure in the nation. His father took him to Afghanistan as a boy, and he ended up fighting on the side of Al-Qaeda along with other terrorist groups during the war. He was wounded in a battle against American forces, and allegedly killed a Sergeant 1st Class by the name of Christopher Speer with a grenade. Later, he was captured and sent to Guantanamo Bay where he was interrogated by American and Canadian intelligence officers. In 2010, he pled guilty to war crimes after 8 years in custody. He returned to Canada to serve the rest of his term here. Controversy arose from his treatment at Guantanamo Bay. The UN has found that he is the first person since World War II to be prosecuted for war crimes as a minor. Civil rights activists across the nation voiced disdain for the actions of our intelligence services, and the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that they violated his human rights. Khadr was released on bail in 2015, but the Conservatives sought to appeal this decision. The new Liberal administration is now considering dropping this appeal. Canadians will surely react negatively either way this goes."

 #Fate of the  Bombardier CSeries
 canada_md_politics.23.t: "Fate of the Bombardier CSeries"
 canada_md_politics.23.d: "Our aerospace industry is hurting, and that has led to some desperate measures by Bombardier. Their newest passenger jet, the CSeries, fills a niche in the market which could potentially bring them fortune. However, not many companies have been buying these jets. In response, Bombardier slashed the price on each well below the production cost to make them more enticing. Each jet is being sold for $19 million despite costing $33 million to produce. Boeing did not like this one bit, as it presented tough competition for their MAX 7. Thus, they filed a petition against Bombardier. It is somewhat hypocritical that they are accusing Bombardier of unfair economic advantages when they themselves receive massive tax breaks from the American government. Nonetheless, this could be a death blow to our aerospace industry. It does not help that the current American administration has been accusing us of taking advantage of our trade relationship. Luckily, Europe has come to our aid. Airbus wants to acquire a majority stake in the CSeries program in exchange for exclusive benefits to Canada. The Europeans are trustworthy allies, but we will not be nearly as independent in this industry if we take the offer."
 canada_md_politics.23.a: "Better we work with the Europeans than kneel to the Americans."
 canada_md_politics.23.b: "Selling out to Europe solves nothing"
 #The USA wants to renegotiate NAFTA
 canada_md_politics.24.t: "The United States Announces Intent to Renegotiate NAFTA"
 canada_md_politics.24.d: "President Donald Trump made it very clear in his campaign platform that he is not a fan of NAFTA. Now, his administration has made this official by announcing their intent to totally overhaul the trade agreement. Both our own government and our counterparts in Mexico have been expecting this. Trump will not make negotiations easy, but there is a fallback plan for us which does not exist for the Mexicans. NAFTA was the successor to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, and terminating it might just lead to us defaulting back to the terms in that deal. Of course, we will do our best to negotiate a new agreement which works for all three nations. Falling back to CUSFTA can be considered our backup plan."
 canada_md_politics.24.a: "We cannot abandon the Mexicans, and working with them is the only way to beat Trump."
 canada_md_politics.24.b: "Even a united front will be unable to sway the Americans"
 #Plans to increase military spending
 canada_md_politics.25.t: "Even a united front will be unable to sway the Americans"
 canada_md_politics.25.d: "Our military and allies in NATO have been persistently asking our administration to spend more on security. They make a good argument too. Our military has been struggling to keep up with the times these past few decades. Hardware is outdated, and recruitment is on the decline. We have also been deploying our forces to an increasing number of conflict zones overseas. Our sovereignty in the north will also need to be protected as the ice continues to melt. Defense minister Harjit Sajjan has put forward a new defense policy to tackle these concerns. It calls for an overhaul of the military over the next 20 years, and this includes a 73% increase to spending over the next decade. This plan will be costly, and it is unclear where all the resources necessary will come from."
 canada_md_politics.25.a: "Canada must do more to protect herself and her allies."
 canada_md_politics.25.b: "The military is capable enough already."
 #Canada Celebrates 150 years
 canada_md_politics.26.t: "Canada 150 Celebrations"
 canada_md_politics.26.d: "It has been 150 years since Canadian Confederation. The federal and provincial governments are hosting the largest celebrations in the country’s history. Shows are being put on, national parks are free to access, and commemorative coins have been minted. We also have a giant duck swimming around Lake Ontario. Some of our friends across the world have sent gifts too. The Dutch have bred a tulip that looks just like the Maple Leaf flag. Despite all this, not everyone is excited today. Some are criticizing the high cost of the festivities, and they would rather see the money put elsewhere. Indigineous groups assert that the sesquicentennial only reinforces hundreds of years of colonial rule. Both these points have caused a bit of tension among Canadians."
 canada_md_politics.26.a: "What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore the world."
 canada_md_politics.26.b: "Forget the Past!"
