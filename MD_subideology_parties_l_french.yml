While the Reform Movement once waged an underground insurgency against the Saudi government as the Organization for Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula, in the 90s it moderated its rhetoric, broke off ties with Iran and agreed to dissolve itself in order to reach an accord with King Fahd, who agreed to release its members. Today the former members of the movement support moderate reform over Iranian-inspired revolution, a strategy that has allowed the Saudi monarchy to tolerate their continued activity but which has alienated the more radically-minded Shia youth."

Drawing upon the ideology of Sayyid Qutb, al-Qaeda has come to be the organization most commonly associated with Islamic terror. Its appeal for global jihad has allowed it to gain a presence across the Muslim world. Ever since King Fahd rejected bin Laden's offer of military assistance against Saddam Hussein during the invasion of Kuwait and instead solicited American support, al-Qaeda has sought to overthrow the House of Saud by force."

The al-Sauds have relied on an alliance with the followers of al-Wahhab,a Salafi cleric who advocated a return to a "purer" form of Sunni Islam. The religious legitimacy granted by Wahhabism has supported Saudi rule through the issuing of fatwas by Wahhabi clerics that sanctify Saudi political decisions. The Saudi brand of Salafism, which forbids any form of political opposition and protest, is distinct from more populist brands of Salafism which oppose the concentration of religious authority in a political elite or advocate global jihad."

 BHR.Vilayat_e_Faqih_desc: "Shia Islamist (Hardline) - The Haq movement is a hardline splinter group of Wefaq which draws support from Shia Bahrainis disappointed by the lack of success of Wefaq's moderate approach to reform. These supporters are often Shia youths who have sometimes formed small gangs that throw stones and Molotov cocktails at police officers. Unlike Wefaq, the Haq movement supports the downfall of the al Khalifa dynasty and the establishment of a Bahraini republic."

It has been the most powerful voice calling for political reform in Bahrain, and has therefore been a major thorn in the side of the Bahraini monarchy. Despite representing the interests of Bahrain's Shia population, al Wefaq has been careful to distance itself from Iran and has employed moderate rhetoric and methods to achieve its goals."

It represents the interests of Shia followers of Mohammad Hussaini Shirazi, a prominent Shia figure who came to reject the Islamic Republic of Iran's form of government. Doctrinal differences with al Wefaq has led to friction between the two parties, despite their shared opposition to the al Khalifa dynasty."

 HKG.conservatism_desc: "Centrist - The Democratic Party was the largest party in Hong Kong's first ever elected legislature in 1995. It is one of the most moderate pan-democrat parties, seeking compromise with Beijing in a way that has alienated some of its former supporters."
 HKG.liberalism: "£generic_liberalism_small Citizens Party"
 HKG.liberalism_desc: "Liberal - The Citizens Party, like the other members of the pro-democracy camp, calls for universal suffrage and the protection of individual liberties. What sets the party apart is its concern for environmental protection and minority rights."
 HKG.liberalism_2006: "£HKG_liberalism_2006 Civic Party"
 HKG.liberalism_2006_desc: "Liberal - The Civic Party is a mainstream pro-democracy party founded by a group of barristers that focuses on the issues of universal suffrage, civil liberties and rule of law."
 HKG.socialism: "£generic_socialism_small The Frontier"
 HKG.socialism_desc: "Social Democrat - Emily Lau's brainchild, the Frontier, is a more radical pro-democracy party than some of the other pan-democrats, calling for a new constitution to replace the Basic Law."
 HKG.socialism_2006: "£generic_socialism_small League of Social Democrats (LSD)"
 HKG.socialism_2006_desc: "Social Democrat - The League of Social Democrats alliance is a "progressive democrat" party that, unlike the other pan-democrat parties, associates itself closely with a street action agenda."

 HKG.socialism_2016_desc: "Social Democrat - The People Power - League of Social Democrats alliance is a combination of two "progressive democrat" parties that, unlike the other pan-democrat parties, associate themselves closely with a street action agenda."
 HKG.Communist-State: "£generic_Communist_State_small People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison"
 HKG.Communist-State_desc: "Communist - The PLA Garrison in Hong Kong exists to maintain the defence of the Special Administration Region. While the Basic Law restricts the Garrison from interfering in local affairs, the Garrison can be called upon to restore public order if so requested by the Hong Kong government."
 HKG.Conservative: "£HKG_Conservative Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB)"
 HKG.Conservative_desc: "Conservative - The DAB has been the main pro-Beijing party in the Legislative Council, remaining consistently supportive of integration with the mainland. The party has also adopted a socially conservative position, opposing gay marriage and maintaining close links to evangelical Christian organisations."
 HKG.Autocracy: "£HKG_Autocracy The New People's Party (NPP)"
 HKG.Autocracy_desc: "Conservative - The New People's Party is widely viewed as an electoral vehicle for the prominent pro-Beijing politician, Regina Ip. Her advocacy of national security legislation and her claims that foreign powers used social media to interfere in protests have made her a controversial figure."
 HKG.anarchist_communism: "£HKG_anarchist_communism Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (HKFTU)"
 HKG.anarchist_communism_desc: "Left-Wing Radicalism - The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions has for a long time been closely associated with the CCP in China. The trade union played a major role in the 1967 Leftists riots against the British colonial authorities, and today maintains its pro-Beijing, working class position that sets it apart from both the anti-Beijing pan-democrats and the other, more middle class pro-Beijing parties."
 HKG.Neutral_conservatism: "£generic_Neutral_conservatism_small Path of Democracy"
 HKG.Neutral_conservatism_desc: "Centrist - Path of Democracy is a small centrist party that portrays itself as above the binary distinction between the pro-Beijing camp and the pan-democrats. It pushes for an approach that compromises between the two sides, but rallies relatively little support in this endeavour."
 HKG.Neutral_Libertarian: "£generic_Neutral_Libertarian_small Third Side"
 HKG.Neutral_Libertarian_desc: "Libertarian - Third Side is a small centrist party that portrays itself as above the binary distinction between the pro-Beijing camp and the pan-democrats.

 HKG.oligarchism: "£generic_oligarchism_small Liberal Party"
 HKG.oligarchism_desc: "Oligarchic - The Liberal Party is a pro-business and socially conservative political party. Despite being a member of the Pro-Beijing camp, the party has not always been on the same page as its supposed allies, vocally opposing the government on a number of occasions."
 HKG.Neutral_green: "£generic_Neutral_green_small Green Party Hong Kong"
 HKG.Neutral_green_desc: "Green - The Green Party of Hong Kong is a small environmentalist party with left-wing ideals. It is a member of the Asia Pacific Greens Federation."
 HKG.Nat_Populism: "£generic_Nat_Populism_small Localists"
 HKG.Nat_Populism_desc: "Nationalist Populism - The localists are a political grouping that encompasses a wide-range of different parties, united by their desire for self-determination in Hong Kong. Groups like Youngspiration, Demosisto and the Hong Kong National Party came to the fore during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and represent a new, more radical and more populist brand of Hong Kong politics, one that is marred by controversy. Some localists advocate for a preservation of Hong Kong's unique culture, others for restrictions on tourism and immigration from the mainland. Some of the more extreme localists advocate independence or even a temporary return to British rule as a transitionary measure. Regardless, they are viewed with admiration by a significant proportion of the youth and disapproval verging on disgust by the older segment of the population."
