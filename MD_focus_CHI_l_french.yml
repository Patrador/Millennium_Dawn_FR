In the years leading up to the turn of the millennium, Jiang kicked off his term with a number of different policies including a series of privatizations."
  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures: "End PLA Business Ventures"
  CHI_End_PLA_Business_Ventures_desc: "In order to make up for defence budget cuts, the country’s military, the PLA, started acquiring business ventures in the 1970s. However the government has recently started to become concerned by this phenomenon. A new directive to remove the PLA from most sectors of the economy is therefore necessary, but in order to placate the military we must implement this alongside an increase in the budget."
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC: "The Future of the CPC"
  CHI_Future_of_the_CPC_desc: "As much as the Communist Party of China likes to present itself as a strong, united entity, it is not immune to fissures along factional lines. We must choose which, if any faction we desire to favour."
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought: "Three Represents Thought"
  CHI_Three_Represents_Thought_desc: "The “Three Represents” is a theory of what the Communist Party represents as put forward by Jiang Zemin. The theory states that the Communist Party must be representative of advanced social productive forces, advanced culture, and the interests of the majority."
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance: "Communist Youth League Dominance"
  CHI_Youth_League_Dominance_desc: "The Chinese Communist Youth League is an influential organization that has groomed a large number of Communist Party officials, including vice-president Hu Jintao. The alumni of the organization tend to be slightly more politically liberal than other party officials, and tend to identify themselves more with the rural lower classes, striving for socioeconomic equality wherever possible."
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity: "Preserve CPC Unity"
  CHI_Preserve_CPC_Unity_desc: "China cannot prosper if either the Communist Youth League or the Shanghai clique wield too much unchallenged influence. We must strive to keep both factions in check."

  CHI_Shanghai_Clique_Dominance_desc: "The Shanghai Clique is a political faction centred around Jiang Zemin, a grouping made up predominantly of pro-business politicians, princelings, and individuals hailing from China’s more wealthy, urban areas. This faction is keen to implement free-market reforms and rapid economic development as quickly as possible."
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare: "End Class Warfare"
  CHI_End_Class_Warfare_desc: "As a result of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents Thought”, the foundations of Chinese political thought have been substantially, if subtly amended. While Mao’s underlying ideology relied on class warfare in favour of the rural peasants against the urban bourgeoisie, Jiang’s more pro-business orientation has led him to favour an end to this aspect of Chinese governance."
  CHI_Hu_Jintao_Agenda: "Hu Jintao's Agenda"
  CHI_Hu_Jintao_Agenda_desc: "The rise of the Communist Youth League or Tuanpai faction has allowed Hu Jintao to assume leadership of the People's Republic of China. His vision for the country is one that is less growth-oriented and more in-tune with those left behind by China's rapid development than Jiang's."
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise: "China's Peaceful Rise"
  CHI_Peaceful_Rise_desc: "The perception of China as a threat to international peace and security is not uncommon in the US and amongst our neighbours. To counter this, we should adopt the official policy of “China’s peaceful rise” or, to put it in an even less threatening way, “China’s peaceful development”. This will assure our Western and regional partners that we do not seek conflict."
  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development: "Scientific Outlook on Development"
  CHI_Scientific_Outlook_on_Development_desc: "In many ways a backlash by Hu Jintao against the growth-centric focus of Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, the “Scientific Outlook on Development” is the theoretical underpinning of Hu’s government, one that focuses on sustainable growth that minimizes environmental pollution and socioeconomic inequality."
  CHI_Harmonious_Society: "Harmonious Society"
  CHI_Harmonious_Society_desc: "As part of Hu Jintao’s scientific outlook on development, the Chinese government is under a new directive to establish a “harmonious society” in which social injustice is not left unchecked in the wake of unhindered economic growth."
  CHI_Green_GDP: "Green GDP"
  CHI_Green_GDP_desc: "A key tenet of the scientific outlook on development is sustainability. As such, we should encourage provincial officials to measure economic growth with a new yardstick, Green GDP. If this policy becomes widespread, this could reduce the level of environmental degradation that is brought about by our rapid economic development."
  CHI_Set_up_Confucius_Institutes: "Set up Confucius Institutes"
  CHI_Set_up_Confucius_Institutes_desc: "In order to project Chinese soft power abroad, we can establish Confucius Institutes around the world to teach Chinese culture and the Chinese language."

  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema: "Develop Chinese Cinema"
  CHI_Develop_Chinese_Cinema_desc: " America has Hollywood, India has Bollywood. Even Nigeria has Nollywood. The Chinese film industry has historically had little success beyond China’s borders, failing even to achieve substantial popularity within China itself. Investing in the Chinese film industry can help further our cultural diplomacy by giving a much needed boost to our soft power."
  CHI_8_Honours_8_Shames: "8 Honours and 8 Shames"
  CHI_8_Honours_8_Shames_desc: "Chinese governments since Mao Zedong have strived to maintain the integrity and character of the Chinese people, ours shall be no different.

  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda: "Zeng Qinghong's Agenda"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Agenda_desc: "The strengthening of the Shanghai Clique has paved the way for Jiang Zemin’s so-called “hatchet man” to assume leadership of the Communist Party and the nation. Zeng will have to overcome his limited popularity in the party relative to figures like Hu Jintao and Wen Jiaobao to push his reformist agenda."
  CHI_Elitist_Politics: "Elitist Politics"
  CHI_Elitist_Politics_desc: "One of the Shanghai Clique's most significant agendas is elitist politics, the idea that the formerly frowned upon "new classes" like businessmen and people returning from overseas should be able to become party officials."
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military: "Affirm Ties to the Military"
  CHI_Affirm_Ties_to_the_Military_desc: "In order to make changes to the composition of the Communist Party, Zeng Qinghong must make use of his connections to powerful military generals. These ties must be strengthened before any inevitably unpopular reformist agenda is pursued."
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought: "Zeng Qinghong Thought"
  CHI_Zeng_Qinghong_Thought_desc: "Building upon Jiang Zemin’s “Three Represents”, Zeng has formulated a new ideological underpinning for the CPC, one that stresses the duty of the party to represent the majority of Chinese people. Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people."
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy: "Intra-Party Democracy"
  CHI_Intra_Party_Democracy_desc: "One of Zeng Qinghong’s key ideas is that of intra-party democracy, in which elections are used to select local-level party secretaries. Now that he has come to power, this idea can be expanded to encompass a range of new reforms to increase transparency and accountability within the communist party."
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy: "Increase Local Autonomy"
  CHI_Increase_Local_Autonomy_desc: "Part of Zeng Qinghong’s transparency initiative is the construction of a more federal system, one in which officials can be more accountable and feel more connected to the provinces in which they operate."
  CHI_Public_Examinations: "Public Examinations"
  CHI_Public_Examinations_desc: "In order to fill the Communist Party apparatus with the most competent officials possible, Zeng has ordered that all lower-level posts should be filled through rigorous public examinations rather than by appointment. This policy will require a more substantial party bureaucracy."
  CHI_Succession_Question: "The Succession Question"
  CHI_Succession_Question_desc: "While the princeling vice-president Xi Jinping is widely considered to be the most likely choice to succeed the current president, his fellow princeling Bo Xilai has been a rising star in Chinese politics for several years now and came close to threatening Xi’s ascension to the position of vice-president."
  CHI_Promote_Youth_League_Members: "Promote Youth League Members"
  CHI_Promote_Youth_League_Members_desc: "We should shore up the position of Hu Jintao's allies, graduates of the Communist Youth League, also known as the Tuanpai or members of the populist coalition."
  CHI_Wang_Lijun_Incident: "The Wang Lijun Incident"
  CHI_Wang_Lijun_Incident_desc: "Bo Xilai poses too great a threat to our government and our vision for China to be left unopposed. We should use current events to our advantage, and seek to put a stop to Bo's seemingly inexorable rise by any means possible."
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda: "Xi Jinping's Agenda"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Agenda_desc: "With Bo Xilai out of the way, the path is clear for a smooth transition of power to vice-president Xi Jinping. A princeling who does not fit squarely within either the Tuanpai/Youth League Faction or the Shanghai Clique, Xi will have to build consensus and achieve compromise within the politically turbulent communist party."
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought: "Xi Jinping Thought"
  CHI_Xi_Jinping_Thought_desc: "Xi Jinping's contribution to the theoretical basis of the CPC's rule is one that establishes a large number of lofty goals for the party. What sets this particular theory apart from those of most of Xi's predecessors is the extent to which adherance to this ideology is tied to loyalty. Loyalty to the party, loyalty to the country, but also significantly, loyalty to Xi Jinping himself."
  CHI_China_Dream: "The Chinese Dream"
  CHI_China_Dream_desc: "A concept frequently alluded to by Xi Jinping, the Chinese Dream encapsulates the goals of the Chinese individual and nation. As such, it includes aspirations in a large variety of areas including the economic, political, and international spheres."
  CHI_Flowing_Spring: "Flowing Spring"
  CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc: "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled "Flowing Spring" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity. Rather than a more moderated approach to China's future, the concept of the flowing spring calls upon Chinese citizens to regain their lost greatness and achieve the most they possibly can."
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society: "Xiaokang Society"
  CHI_Xiaokang_Society_desc: "The idea of a moderately prosperous society is not a new one in Chinese politics. Nonethless, Xi Jinping has decided to give this concept a new lease of life, calling upon the nation to strive for a country that is equally and only moderately well-off."

  CHI_Restructure_the_Penal_System: "Restructure the Penal System"
  CHI_Restructure_the_Penal_System_desc: "The time has come for us to abolish the policy of re-education through labour. This is a practice that we have been widely condemned for and the gains that it has yielded have been relatively insignificant."
  CHI_Establish_the_National_Security_Commission: "Establish the National Security Commission"
  CHI_Establish_the_National_Security_Commission_desc: "Having a commission in charge of the country's security chaired by [CHI.GetLeader] will help centralize control over China's sprawlng security apparatus."
  CHI_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns: "Anti-Corruption Campaign"
  CHI_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc: "The time has come for us to start securing our grip on power. Many political rivals of [CHI.GetLeader] remain politically active and constitute a threat, however slim, to our government. Under the guise of fighting corruption, we can take down these officials and remove the threat that they pose."
  CHI_Establish_the_Central_Group_for_Military_Reform: "The Central Group for Military Reform"
  CHI_Establish_the_Central_Group_for_Military_Reform_desc: "While a strong institution, the PLA still lags behind the militaries of some of our more advanced rivals. To become a world-class force we should establish a group to formulate possible reforms."
  CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League: "Weaken the Youth League"
  CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League_desc: "The populist coalition headed by the Tuanpai or Youth League Faction retains significant influence due to the significant degree of independence possessed by the Communist Youth League. By reducing this independence and conducting bribery investigations against Youth League members such as Ling Jihua, we can make the Youth League cease to be an important force in Chinese politics."
  CHI_Take_Down_the_Big_Tigers: "Take Down the Big Tigers"
  CHI_Take_Down_the_Big_Tigers_desc: "The elitist coalition, dominated by "princelings" and Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique, retains a large number of high-ranking posts in the CPC. Luckily for us, a large number of this officials are involved in corruption due to the nepotism of Jiang Zemin's government. This provides the perfect excuse to take these "big tigers" down, and with it the power and influence of the Shanghai clique."

  CHI_Remove_Term_Limits: "Remove Term Limits"

  CHI_Cult_of_Personality: "Cult of Personality"
  CHI_Cult_of_Personality_desc: "[CHI.GetLeader] is a powerful personality and we should make use of this. A cult of personality will shore up his position not just within the party but throughout the country."
  CHI_War_on_Crime: "War on Crime"
  CHI_War_on_Crime_desc: "During his time as Party secretary of Chongqing, Bo Xilai made fighting organized crime one of his top priorities. Now that he can extend his method of governing to the entire country, it is high time that the corrupt businessmen and triad bosses in the rest of the country meet the same fates as their Chongqing-based brethren."
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model: "The Chongqing Model"
  CHI_The_Chongqing_Model_desc: "The Chongqing Model is Bo Xilai's contribution to Communist Party doctrine. It is a model that includes a wide range of social and economic policies, including "strike black" and "sing red" campaigns that involve fighting organized crime and singing communist songs respectively. The model also represents a slight departure from China's market liberalization policies."
  CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms: "Jasic Labor Reforms"
  CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms_desc: "Labor disputes are a significant hinderance to the government's legitimacy. Workers at Jasic Technology in particular have sought to unionize in order to fight for their rights. We should demonstrate our commitment to the workers by possessing a flexible attitude towards Chinese workers, starting with those at Jasic Technology."
  CHI_Expand_Welfare: "Expand Welfare"
  CHI_Expand_Welfare_desc: "We cannot claim to be a socialist country without a strong safety net for our country's system."
  CHI_Red_Culture_Movement: "Red Culture Movement"
  CHI_Red_Culture_Movement_desc: "The "sing red" element of Bo Xilai's Chongqing model may seem frivolous and bizarre, but it encouraging people to sing Maoist songs together works wonders for national unity."
  CHI_Humanist_Marxism: "Humanist Marxism"
  CHI_Humanist_Marxism_desc: "The "New Left" ideology put forward by Bo Xilai and others is one that favours a return to aspects of Maoist socialism such as state-planning and collectivism. Now that he has come to power, Bo can pursue his leftist agenda under the banner of "humanist marxism"."
  CHI_Nanjie_Model: "The Nanjie Model"
  CHI_Nanjie_Model_desc: "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai: "Purge the Tuanpai"
  CHI_Purge_Tuanpai_desc: "The Youth League faction, or Tuanpai, has gotten too ambitious and must be cut down to size. It is high time that we purge these so-called populists and replace them with those who better suit our aspirations for China's future."
  CHI_Promote_Princelings: "Promote Princelings"
  CHI_Promote_Princelings_desc: "While the venerable members of Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique have served China well, it is time for them to retire and make way for a new generation of leaders. The princelings, children of China's original revolutionaries, should take the place of both the Tuanpai and the Shanghai clique."
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda: "Bo Xilai's Agenda"
  CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc: "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent "New Left" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands: "Scrap Military Commands"
  CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc: "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict. To remedy this, we should regroup these military commands into four strategic zones: North, South, East and West. However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers: "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
  CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc: "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force. In order to make our military more mobile, nimble, and responsive, we should reduce our reliance on the ground forces by cutting troop numbers."
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption: "Stamp Out Corruption"
  CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc: "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."
  CHI_Naval_Capability_Enhancements: "Naval Capability Enhancements"
  CHI_Naval_Capability_Enhancements_desc: "Many of the threats we face are maritime in nature. To the East and South lie suspicious neighbours, while all around our sphere of influence, American naval bases bear down on our territorial waters. Our current navy must be improved if we stand any hope of defending ourselves from these multiple fronts."
  CHI_Aerial_Capability_Enhancements: "Aerial Capability Enhancements"
  CHI_Aerial_Capability_Enhancements_desc: "In the 21st century he who wins the war in the air wins the war on the land and in the sea too. While our aerospace technology is catching up to our geopolitical rivals, we currently lack the air doctrine to match these developments."
  CHI_Network_Centric_Warfare: "Network Centric Warfare"
  CHI_Network_Centric_Warfare_desc: "No longer can we rely on Korean War-era "human wave" tactics. We should improve our usage of network-centric warfare if we are to be a serious contender on the battlefields of tomorrow."
  CHI_Network_Centric_Warfare_bonus: "Network Centric Warfare"
  CHI_De_Politicize_the_Military: "De-Politicize the Military"
  CHI_De_Politicize_the_Military_desc: "While the PLA's loyalty to the CPC ensures the security and stability of our one-party state, it is undeniable that this politicization of the military has, at least in part, diminished the ability of the PLA to function as an effective war-fighting force."
  CHI_Preserve_the_Revolution: "Preserve the Revolution!"
  CHI_Preserve_the_Revolution_desc: "The millennium presents new challenges to our government's authority. We should decide whether we wish to respond to these challenges by blocking them our embracing them."
  CHI_Internet_Crackdown: "Internet Crackdown"
  CHI_Internet_Crackdown_desc: "The internet is nothing more than a hotbed of discontent and insurrection. We should prevent our citizens from using this form of media and censor all others along with it."

  CHI_Netizen_Nation_desc: "The internet is not a substantial threat to our authority. In fact, we may even be able to use it to our advantage."
  CHI_An_Open_Window: "An Open Window"
  CHI_An_Open_Window_desc: "Deng Xiaoping once famously described the opening up of China as opening a window for fresh air. While, as Deng also said, some "flies" are bound to fly in when this happens, this is a risk we must take to enjoy the benefits of openness."
  CHI_Let_a_Hundred_Flowers_Bloom: "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"
  CHI_Let_a_Hundred_Flowers_Bloom_desc: "In 1956, Mao Zedong initiated the Hundred Flowers Campaign, calling for Chinese citizens to openly air their grievances towards the government. While that campaign ended in repression and a return to the status quo, a reboot of the same campaign does not necessarily have to end the same way."
  CHI_Freedom_of_Speech: "Freedom of Speech"
  CHI_Freedom_of_Speech_desc: "Now that we have allowed our citizens to air their grievances, it has become clear that our society has progressed to the point where such things can be said in public without threatening the stability of the nation. We should proceed with further"
  CHI_Allow_Foreign_Social_Media: "Allow Foreign Social Media"
  CHI_Allow_Foreign_Social_Media_desc: "Social media sites like Facebook are starting to gain traction. Despite the risks, we should allow these sites to operate in our country as part of our "Open Window" policy."
  CHI_Liberalize_the_Media: "Liberalize the Media"
  CHI_Liberalize_the_Media_desc: "Up till this point, all forms of media in China have had a strong state influence whether directly or indirectly. The time has come for us to end this."
  CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles: "Question the Four Cardinal Principles"
  CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles_desc: "Deng Xiaoping's Four Cardinal Principles included upholding the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and Maozedong thought. The inclusion of these principles means that debate about the nature of authoritarian rule in China has not been allowed. If our country is to progress, this should be amended to help diversify debate on China's future."
  CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties: "Unchain the 8 Democratic Parties"
  CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties_desc: "While the Communist Party dominates Chinese politics, 8 other legal parties exist as part of the country's political system. However, up until now they have had little influence over policy and lack an independent voice. The lifting of restrictions on these existing political parties could act as a test to ascertain the viability of establishing multi-party democracy in China."
  CHI_Free_and_Fair_Elections: "Democracy with Chinese Characteristics"
  CHI_Free_and_Fair_Elections_desc: "Democracy as we know it is European in origin. While our recent liberalizations have put us on a path towards adopting Western-style institutions, that does not mean that we have to compromise our traditional cultural values."
  CHI_Support_the_Communists: "Support the Communists"
  CHI_Support_the_Communists_desc: "Even if we have done away with China's one-party rule, that does not mean that the CPC is not the best party to guide China into this new chapter of its history."
  CHI_Support_the_Pro_Western_Coalition: "Support the Pro-Western Coalition"

  CHI_Support_the_Non_Aligned_Coalition_desc: "China's place is not to pick sides in a world increasingly becoming divided between the West and those who wish to over-turn the existing international order. Instead, we should look to our own interests and seek good relations with both sides."

  CHI_The_Great_Firewall_of_China_desc: "The worldwide web is a dangerous place and we should do our best to protect our citizens from the parts of it which most threaten them. Our new, updated take on China's historic Great Wall, a barrier that protected this country for millennia, will ensure subversive, untrue and divisive content stays out of the sight and mind of the Chinese people."
  CHI_Facial_Recognition_Surveillance: "Facial Recognition Surveillance"
  CHI_Facial_Recognition_Surveillance_desc: "Crime is a blight on our nation and the technology exists for us to track down criminals with ease and efficiency. Making use of this technology will pose no threat to the average, law-abiding citizen."
  CHI_Social_Credit_Scheme: "Social Credit Scheme"
  CHI_Social_Credit_Scheme_desc: "As a government, our goal should be to educate our citizens on correct and beneficial behaviour. This will allow our nation to reach its full potential.

  CHI_Skynet_desc: "Our citizens' safety is our priority. There are no measures that we should not consider if those measures help us preserve peace, stability, and the rule of law.

  CHI_PLA_Cyber_Army: "PLA Cyber Army"
  CHI_PLA_Cyber_Army_desc: "Modern military challenges are often based in the cyber realm rather than the physical one. PLA Unit 61398's directive will be to collect information, safeguard our security and, if need be, wage war in cyber space."
  CHI_Industrial_Espionage: "Industrial Espionage"
  CHI_Industrial_Espionage_desc: "Intellectual property is what Western nations use to defend their current economic advantage. Where was intellectual property in the 19th century when Americans violated copyright laws with impunity to achieve economic growth? Why should we behave any differently? Let us use Unit 61398 to close the technological gap between us and our rivals, or even our erstwhile allies."
  CHI_Global_Propaganda_Network: "Global Propaganda Network"
  CHI_Global_Propaganda_Network_desc: "Our influence abroad is growing, but without ample attention this growth will stop.

  CHI_Proper_State_Atheism: "Proper State Atheism"
  CHI_Proper_State_Atheism_desc: "We should conform to Marx's disdain for religion as the opiate of the masses. While we can tolerate a certain degree of private belief, institutionalized religion is undeniably a threat to the authority of the Communist Party. Whether it be against radical Islam or dangerous cults, we should be on our guard."
  CHI_Crush_the_Falun_Gong: "Crush the Falun Gong"

  CHI_Combat_Islamism: "Combat Islamism"
  CHI_Combat_Islamism_desc: "Islam as a whole is not something we have an issue with. The Hui Muslim minority does not dispute our authority, and as such we grant them room to practise their beliefs. However when it comes to the Uighur Muslims of Xinjiang province, we cannot use the same approach. The East Turkistan Islamic Movement is an Al-Qaeda affiliate and espouses a dangerous ideology of Islamic fundamentalism."
  CHI_Crush_the_Turkistan_Islamic_Party: "Crush the Turkistan Islamic Party"
  CHI_Crush_the_Turkistan_Islamic_Party_desc: "The Turkistan Islamic Party is a new off-shoot of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, one that has continued the radical and violent practices of its predecessor. We should deploy the police and armed forces to hunt down and destroy TIP elements."

  CHI_Xinjiang_Reeducation_Camps_desc: "In order to combat radicalization amongst the Uighur population we have established camps to provide the locals with patriotic and secular teaching.

  CHI_Greater_Freedom_of_Religion: "Greater Freedom of Religion"
  CHI_Greater_Freedom_of_Religion_desc: "While socialism is nominally atheist, we should accept that a substantial proportion of the Chinese population is religious and will remain so. It will suit our long term interest in preserving stability in the country to come to terms with this."

  CHI_Return_of_the_Dalai_Lama_desc: "Tibet has been a source of great concern for our regime in the past few decades. While we have historically dealt with the issue by means of censorship and repression, it may be better for our authority in the province if we were seen to grant concessions to the Tibetan people. One of the greatest concessions we could possibly make is to allow for the return of the Dalai Lama."

It may be in our interest to do so now as promising a continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy could help convince Taiwan to return to our control. However, we might want to quash separatism by demonstrating the strength of our commitment to Chinese sovereignty."

  CHI_Drop_Opposition_to_Taiwanese_Independence_desc: "While in the past we have expressed an intent to prevent Taiwanese independence at all costs, we must now come to realize that belligerence towards Taiwan may suit our purposes less than a more pragmatic approach.

  CHI_North_South_Water_Transfer_desc: "In order to reduce the large imbalance in water supply between China's south and north we should invest in building canals to divert water to key areas of water scarcity.

  CHI_Water_Conservation_Projects: "Water Conservation Projects"

  CHI_Support_Negotiations_desc: "Conflict is the problem and not the solution. We should use the QCCM to persuade our partners to adopt conciliatory but guarded approaches towards militants not out of fear but out of necessity."
  CHI_Joint_Operations: "Joint Anti-Terrorism Operations"
  CHI_Joint_Operations_desc: "Radical Islamist groups are a major threat to regional security and must be met with united, unwavering force of arms."
  CHI_Tackle_the_Root_Causes_of_Radicalization: "Tackle the Root Causes of Radicalization"
  CHI_Tackle_the_Root_Causes_of_Radicalization_desc: "Now that the terrorist threat has been temporarily reduced we should focus our efforts on de-radicalization. We can cut off the recruitment of militant groups by using investments in infrastructure and industry to alleviate poverty in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan."
  CHI_Disengage_from_Pakistan: "Disengage from Pakistan"
  CHI_Disengage_from_Pakistan_desc: "It is time to re-evaluate our approach towards the Indian subcontinent. A close partnership between two of the world's largest economies could be more beneficial to us than a continued alliance with a lesser power. Disengaging from Pakistan will be the first step in our rapprochement with India."
  CHI_End_Joint_Military_Exercises: "End Joint Military Exercises"
  CHI_End_Joint_Military_Exercises_desc: "Our exercises with Pakistan are viewed with suspicion by the Indians. We must end them in order to gain their trust."
  CHI_Strategic_Realignment: "Strategic Realignment"
  CHI_Strategic_Realignment_desc: "Our gradual shift away from Pakistan is now becoming obvious. It is time to make it clear to the Indians that these moves have been attempts to win their favor."
  CHI_Sino_Indian_Treaty_of_Friendship: "Sino-Indian Treaty of Friendship"
  CHI_Sino_Indian_Treaty_of_Friendship_desc: "Our partnership with Pakistan was of course not the only source of friction between us and our Indian counterparts. We will need to address the territorial grievances that our respective countries possess in order to begin a new relationship with India."
  CHI_A_New_Alliance: "A New Alliance"
  CHI_A_New_Alliance_desc: "The remarkable improvement in relations between us and the Indians has opened up a new and valuable opportunity for a military as well as political partnership. An alliance between our two nations represents an unstoppable force in the East and South Asian regions."
  CHI_Strike_Across_the_Himalayas: "Strike Across the Himalayas"
  CHI_Strike_Across_the_Himalayas_desc: "While we should seek to avoid all-out war for now, we have sufficiently strengthened our position so as to allow for a probe of India's defences. Should we be successful in our endeavour we will have taken back territory that is rightfully ours, and should we fail we will have at least learned more about our enemy's capabilities."
  CHI_String_of_Pearls: "String of Pearls"
  CHI_String_of_Pearls_desc: "India's dominance over the Indian Ocean is an undesirable state of affairs. We can seek to contain India much in the same way as America is seeking to contain us, namely by encircling our rival with military bases located in the territory of our regional partners. This encirclement will give us a significant advantage should we enter a state of war with India."
  CHI_Annex_Bhutan: "Annex Bhutan"
  CHI_Annex_Bhutan_desc: "Our claims over Bhutan may not extend over the country's entire territory, but the country's close historical ties to Tibet should provide reasonable justification for our desire to integrate Bhutan into the Tibet Autonomous Region. Moreover, annexation would remove a strategically located Indian ally. Should our influence in Bhutan become sufficiently large we will able to annex the country without a war."
  CHI_Puppet_Nepal: "Puppet Nepal"
  CHI_Puppet_Nepal_desc: "Some political forces in Nepal are willing to significantly strengthen their country's ties to China at the expense of its partnership with India. This would significantly help our foreign policy objectives. Increasing our influence in the country and ensuring a friendly government is in place will allow us to carry out this process peacefully."
  CHI_Bring_the_Tiger_to_Heel: "Cage the Tiger"
  CHI_Bring_the_Tiger_to_Heel_desc: "Our rise to regional hegemony will not be possible with a hostile India poised to attack our southern flank and support our enemies. The Bengal tiger must necessarily be caged in order ensure our dominance in a space that is too small for two regional superpowers."
  CHI_The_Land_of_the_Rising_Sun: "The Land of the Rising Sun"
  CHI_The_Land_of_the_Rising_Sun_desc: "To our northeast lies a great threat as well as a great opportunity for Chinese foreign policy. We are not convinced that Japan will never again become a threat to the Chinese people, but at the same time it may be useful to have the Japanese on our side in the greater struggle with the United States."
  CHI_Maintain_Historical_Enmity: "Maintain Historical Enmity"
  CHI_Maintain_Historical_Enmity_desc: "We have looked on, horrified, as the world has allowed Japan to remilitarize and once again become a threat to the Chinese nation. Our quarrel with Japan does not lie simply in the past. It exists here and now so long as that nation of war criminals continues to possess the means of violence."
  CHI_Demand_the_Diaoyu_Islands: "Demand the Diaoyu Islands"
  CHI_Demand_the_Diaoyu_Islands_desc: "The Diaoyu islands are rightfully ours and are a significant point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations. Demanding the islands will not only win us favor at home but will also provide us with useful information about the mindset of the Japanese government based on their response to our demands."
  CHI_Incite_Anti_Japanese_Sentiment: "Incite Anti-Japanese Sentiment"
  CHI_Incite_Anti_Japanese_Sentiment_desc: "It should not be too difficult to incite anti-Japanese fervor amongst our patriotic population, a sentiment that we can use to our advantage in the confrontation that is to come."
  CHI_Clash_Over_the_East_China_Sea: "Clash Over the East China Sea"
  CHI_Clash_Over_the_East_China_Sea_desc: "We regularly probe Japan's air defences by sending our aircraft into their airspace. It would be all too easy to use one of these instances to spark a much larger crisis..."
  CHI_A_Pragmatic_Approach: "A Pragmatic Approach"
  CHI_A_Pragmatic_Approach_desc: "Our relations with the Japanese have been marred by their refusal to apologize for or even acknowledge the grave injustices that they inflicted on our people during the Sino-Japanese War. Nonetheless, it may be more strategic to set aside our resentment towards the Japanese in order to facilitate an American withdrawl from East Asia."
  CHI_Assuage_Japanese_Concerns: "Assuage Japanese Concerns"
  CHI_Assuage_Japanese_Concerns_desc: "In order to facilitate a rapprochement with Japan we need to reassure the Japanese that our intentions are not hostile. Actions speak louder than words."
  CHI_Encourage_Appreciation_of_Japanese_Culture: "Encourage Appreciation of Japanese Culture"
  CHI_Encourage_Appreciation_of_Japanese_Culture_desc: "Japanese culture is popular among the Chinese people, especially the younger generations. Encouraging this trend will strengthen economic relations between our two countries, bring our two peoples closer together and send positive signals to our counterparts in Tokyo."
  CHI_Sign_Strategic_Partnership_Agreement: "Sign Strategic Partnership Agreement"
  CHI_Sign_Strategic_Partnership_Agreement_desc: "An offical agreement between our two countries will consolidate our recent diplomatic gains and incentivize the Japanese to reduce their reliance on American military protection."
  CHI_Decouple_Japan: "Break the Chain"
  CHI_Decouple_Japan_desc: "The time has come to decouple Japan from America's influence once and for all. Securing an American withdrawal will make our security position in the region significantly more secure."
  CHI_Global_Influence: "Global Influence"
  CHI_Global_Influence_desc: "Past Chinese dynasties considered the outside world beyond China's immediate periphery as not worthy of our attention. This was what led China to fall behind the industralized nations of the West. We will not make this same mistake again."
  CHI_Favor_Multipolarity: "Favor Multipolarity"
  CHI_Favor_Multipolarity_desc: "Our position on hegemony has always been clear. We are opposed to the global hegemony of any nation, whether that nation is the United States, Russia, or even China."
  CHI_Peacekeeping_Contributions: "Peacekeeping Contributions"
  CHI_Peacekeeping_Contributions_desc: "Peacekeeping missions are a useful way for our troops to gain experience of conducting operations in foreign lands, but also signal a commitment of our country to multilateralism and working within international organizations like the United Nations."
  CHI_Support_Security_Council_Reform: "Support Security Council Reform"
  CHI_Support_Security_Council_Reform_desc: "We have historically opposed broadening the United Nations Security Council to include the G4 countries due to our tense relations with Japan and India. Now that relations have improved we can drop this opposition. Whether reform arises as a result of this depends on the will of the other permanent members of the Security Council."
  CHI_A_Rival_Superpower: "A Rival Superpower"
  CHI_A_Rival_Superpower_desc: "We had to reassure the world that we were not seeking hegemony in past decades when our nation was in a much weaker position relative to the West. However, now that our country is no longer an underdeveloped nation we no longer have to maintain this facade and can instead openly strive to replace the United States as sole global hegemon."
  CHI_End_US_Hegemony: "End US Hegemony"
  CHI_End_US_Hegemony_desc: "The US-centric world order is unjust and unsustainable, and we should do our best to ensure its demise. American imperialism must be forced out of the Global South, with the influence of the well-intentioned and the virtuous filling the vacuum that it leaves behind."
  CHI_The_Bears_Backyard: "The Bear's Backyard"
  CHI_The_Bears_Backyard_desc: "Our strategic partnership with Russia has helped in our goal of undermining American hegemony. However our erstwhile allies will not support our newfound ambition for global dominance. We must therefore seek to undermine their position and bring the Slavic giant to its knees."
  CHI_A_New_Imperium: "A New Imperium"
  CHI_A_New_Imperium_desc: "Now that our position in the region and the world at large is secure, it is possible for us to restore China to its former glory and revive territorial claims that were previously considered lost forever. The age of empire and a Sino-centric world order will be imposed on the rest of the globe, whether it likes it or not."
  CHI_Form_the_SCO: "Form the SCO"
  CHI_Form_the_SCO_desc: "Currently the Shanghai Five grouping acts as a way for us to interact closely with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. These interactions have been valuable but could be improved upon further were we to change this informal grouping into a robust intergovernmental organization."
  CHI_Emphasize_Economic_Cooperation: "Emphasize Economic Cooperation"
  CHI_Emphasize_Economic_Cooperation_desc: "The SCO should primarily be a facilitator of economic assistance from wealthy members to poorer members. Our goal of regional stability is best achieved through strengthening the economies of our more fragile neighbors. More than that, the SCO should endeavor to better the lives of those who reside within its boundaries."
  CHI_Civilian_Technology_Sharing: "Civilian Technology Sharing"
  CHI_Civilian_Technology_Sharing_desc: "Our organization is primarily focused on developing the economies of its poorer members, and as such should only focus on the sharing of non-military technologies."

  CHI_Crack_Down_on_the_Three_Evils_desc: "The Three Evils of terrorism, separatism and religious extremism are sources of concern for all SCO members. Through the SCO we can empower each other's political capacity to suppress these dangerous threats."
  CHI_Tackle_Drug_Trafficking: "Tackle Drug Trafficking"
  CHI_Tackle_Drug_Trafficking_desc: "Drug trafficking from Afghanistan is an issue that is difficult for us as an individual country to solve alone but relatively less difficult for a multilateral organization to take on. Together we can more effectively police the porous borders of Central Asia."
  CHI_Emphasize_Military_Cooperation: "Emphasize Military Cooperation"
  CHI_Emphasize_Military_Cooperation_desc: "There is no need for us to mask our intentions. The SCO should be an explicitly security-oriented organization that provides us and our Russian partners with a bulwark against possible aggression from external enemies, chief among those being the United States."
  CHI_Military_Technology_Sharing: "Military Technology Sharing"
  CHI_Military_Technology_Sharing_desc: "Russia's advanced military technology will be an invaluable asset to our members in the event of external aggression."
  CHI_Strengthen_Security_Framework: "Strengthen Security Framework"
  CHI_Strengthen_Security_Framework_desc: "Our existing military cooperation within the SCO, while substantial, may not be sufficient to withstand the full onslaught of a superpower. We should deepen our existing military cooperation so that we as an organization can be better prepared for the worst."
  CHI_Chinese_Dominance: "Chinese Dominance"
  CHI_Chinese_Dominance_desc: "While our position and Russia's within the SCO is currently equal, the inconvenient truth is that our power far outstrips that of our erstwhile allies. Our influence within the organization should correspond to our real-world significance and so Russia should be forced into a junior position."
  CHI_Equal_Partners: "Equal Partners"
  CHI_Equal_Partners_desc: "Even if we have started to overtake the Russians in a lot of areas we still have much to learn from this former superpower. It serves our interests better to keep the Russians onside than to alienate and antagonize them."
  CHI_ASEAN_Integration: "ASEAN Integration"
  CHI_ASEAN_Integration_desc: "The unspoken function of ASEAN was to balance against our influence, so our efforts to improve relations with the ASEAN member states and end their distrust of us means that the way is now clear to integrate ASEAN into the SCO, significantly boosting the membership of our organization."
  CHI_Undermine_ASEAN: "Undermine ASEAN"
  CHI_Undermine_ASEAN_desc: "ASEAN exists as a counterweight to our regional influence and so should be done away with. We can exploit the fact that the organization is made up of multiple different nations with wildly varying outlooks. We can target those nations that are most favourable to our interests and convince them to leave the ASEAN and join the SCO."
  CHI_Exploit_Economic_Clout: "Exploit Economic Clout"
  CHI_Exploit_Economic_Clout_desc: "The financial orientation of the SCO has been highly beneficial for us given our vast superiority in terms of capital. We can now use this economic advantage of ours to consolidate our political influence over the other SCO members."
  CHI_Split_CSTO: "Split CSTO"
  CHI_Split_CSTO_desc: "Our partnership with Russia was never going to last forever. We have never been able to fully trust our expansionist northern neighbor. While it has served our interests up until now to continue the pretence of Sino-Russian cooperation, in order to take the SCO further we must put it to an end. Our shared allies must now make a choice between siding with us and siding with our enemy."

  CHI_An_Alliance_to_Rival_NATO_desc: "The time has come to unlock the SCO's full potential and bolster the organization's institutions for military cooperation to the point where our joint command and control can be as efficient as NATO's. If a war is coming we will be ready."

  CHI_Outsource_Cheap_Labor: "Outsource Cheap Labor"
  CHI_Outsource_Cheap_Labor_desc: "When China was developing our workers were paid minimally and had to suffer tremendous hardships. But their suffering is what has led our country to become as economically successful as it currently is. The nations of Africa should follow the same model."
  CHI_Workers_Rights: "Workers' Rights"
