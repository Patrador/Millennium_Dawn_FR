 EU_tutorial.10.t: "Chapter 1 - The European Union"
 EU_tutorial.10.d: "§Y[EUU.GetFlag] The European Union§! is a unique economic and political union between its member states.\n\nThe EU is similar to a confederation, where many policy areas are federalised into common institutions capable of making law; however the member states are sovereign nations but they have limited their sovereignty and transfered some of their powers to the supranational union.\n\nWhat began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. A name change from the European Economic Community (EEC) to the European Union (EU) in 1993 reflected this."

In the mod the EU is represented and played by the member states. Later in the game the player has the possibility to unite (annex) the member states under one cosmetic tag. Two main factors that drive the EU are the influence on the other member states and the Euroscepticism. Besides that the EU is controlled via the EU Focus Tree and Decisions."

 EU_tutorial.20.t: "Chapter 2 - The EU Focus Tree"
 EU_tutorial.20.d: "The EU Focus Tree is other than any other Focus Tree in the game. The EU Focus Tree is a shared focus tree and does not only belong to a single country, but to all (49 potential) member states. Every EU member state has the shared EU Focus Tree, but these trees are connected. Only one member state can complete a shared voting focus at the same time. If a focus for one country is completed it is bypassed for every other member state. There is one exceptions to this: the Withdrawal Policies branch."

The focuses of the Voting Tree apply there effect not simply through completing the focus, they need to be accepted by the voting of the member states. The only effects that are directly applied are the Euroscepticism bonuses and malus. Some of the branch header have no (other) effect and need no voting. As the focuses need to be accepted by the voting of the member states, there are no mutually exclusive focuses. But some focuses are mutually exclusive in the result. If one is accepted the other can't be completed. See the requires tooltip for details."

 EU_tutorial.32.d: "After the vote the result decision becomes available. When selected the result of the voting is shown by a sequence of two events. If the proposal was accepted the effect of the focus is applied to every member state by the event. If the proposal was dismissed the retry proceeding is started.\n\nNote: In some rare circumstances the voting process could be locked. In this case you have to wait round about three month til the voting is cleared in the background. Than just try again."

If one member state selects that decision the decision is removed for every other member state and a new voting decision becomes visible for the member state. So that member state can start the voting proceeding again. The AI (in this order President of the European Commission, President of the European Council or President of the European Parliament) will take the retry decision. If you want to select the retry, you should pause the game or disable the AI retry. The retry of the AI can be disabled via a decision."

The government resist factor reflects the attitude of the political parties towards the subject of the voting.

To claim an office a member state needs at least 5% influence on every other member state or a population of more than 5% of the Total EU Population. So it is more likly that the most offices are shared among the big member states."

 EU_tutorial.60.d: "Euroscepticism is one of the basic concepts for the EU in Millennium Dawn.\n\nEuroscepticism, also known as EU-scepticism, means criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration. According to public opinion surveys this ratio represents the number of people who will likely vote for leaving the European Union in the case of a European Union membership referendum of their country.\nEuropeanism also known as Pro-Europeanism, sometimes called European Unionism, is a political position that favours European integration and membership of the European Union (EU). It includes the more radical European federalists, who seek to create a single superstate known informally as a United States of Europe. A related term is ’Europhile’. The ratio represents the Europhile people throughout the whole Union.\n\nEuroscepticism is one of the main variable driving the EU member states in one direction or the other. Europeanism on the other hand is just a derivative variable from Euroscepticism. It is used as trigger to refer to the Union as a whole."

 EU_tutorial.62.d: "One source of Euroscepticism are the focuses on completition. Most of them add Euroscepticism to all current and potential member states. Some add a special amount to certain countries. This reflects the unique national tradition in some policies areas, like financial discipline in the nothern countries or soft currency in the southern member states.\n\nAnother source of Euroscepticism are the Euroscepticism Campaign Decisions. On the other side of the coin the Pro-European Campaigns can reduce the Euroscepticism.\n\nFinally there are some events and decision, which can add or reduce the Euroscepticism.

But Euroscepticism is not the only factor for an EU exit. The probability from the Euroscepticism is modified by the ruling party. Governments with nationalist outlook will always try to leave the Union. Conservative governments are pro-European in general, but they flip over in the exit camp, when Euroscepticism rises above 60%. All other major European parties try to stay in the EU, but somewhere above 70% Euroscepticism they can't ignore the will of the people."
