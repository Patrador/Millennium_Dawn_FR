 BOS_economic_reform:0 "Economic Reform"
 BOS_economic_reform_desc:0 "Bosnia and Herzegovina has emerged from the 1990s a ruined state - a long and bloody war between 1992 and 1995 has exhausted the Bosnian people, and has destroyed the country's private economy and public education system. Many Bosnians have fled, and recovery has been slow. Bosnia is among the Europe's poorest countries and must establish a strong economy if that is ever to change."
 BOS_invest_in_the_private_economy:0 "Invest in the Private Economy"
 BOS_invest_in_the_private_economy_desc:0 "Formerly a communist state under Yugoslavia, Bosnia has learnt the potential damages of refusing to foster a private economic sector. By encouraging the growth of small and medium businesses in the country, jobs can be created and wages raised, which will eventually attract major corporations from abroad and allow Bosnia's own companies to grow to international scale."
 BOS_expand_conscription:0 "Expand Conscription"
 BOS_expand_conscription_desc:0 "All logical economic incentives are in favor of abolishing universal military service in favor of a volunteer army. However, logical economic incentives cannot protect us from Belgrade or Zagreb. Bosnia and its proud military, veterans of the war against Serbia, need to stand firm and watchful of Serbian - or even Croatian - transgressions."
 BOS_grant_funds_to_the_regional_economic_developments:0 "Regional Development"
 BOS_grant_funds_to_the_regional_economic_developments_desc:0 "Both Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina are applying for additional development funding from the Sarajevo government. To provide it to them would mean a potential debt that the federal entities would find themselves in, assuring increased loyalty to the federal government."
 BOS_economic_innovations:0 "Economic Innovations"
 BOS_economic_innovations_desc:0 "Bosnia has fallen behind in cutting edge technology and social progress. To catch up to the western European powers we aspire to be like, the Bosnian people need to be able to enjoy world class education and highly specialized positions of labor. We need to develop our domestic industry and modernize it before the growth of wages makes our cheap labor force unattractive to western companies."
 BOS_exploit_banja_luka_iron_ore:0 "Exploit Banja Luka iron ore"
 BOS_exploit_banja_luka_iron_ore_desc:0 "While Bosnia does not possess great amounts of the fanciest of natural resources - say, oil -, this just means we are safe from an American invasion. We can still use what he have to our advantage. Bosnia and Herzegovina possesses bauxite, coal and iron ore in significant quantities. Especially the iron ore, if refined into steel, will be very appealing to foreign nations."
 BOS_youth_employment_programs:0 "Youth Employment Programs"
 BOS_youth_employment_programs_desc:0 "Bosnia and Herzegovina has the highest youth unemployment in the world, higher even than Afghanistan, Burkina Faso or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. More than half of our people under 25 do not have jobs. After freeing them from the weight of conscription, we must now attract foreign businesses magnates to get our young people into factories and the service industry."
 BOS_approach_the_erasmus_program:0 "Approach the ERASMUS Program"
 BOS_approach_the_erasmus_program_desc:0 "ERASMUS is the logistical network of universities in the European Union. Through our connections to our European partners, we might be able to get the youngest bright Bosnians into cities like Frankfurt, London and Paris and to study at the most prestigious universities in the world. Many young Bosnians already take that opportunity, and we need to make sure Bosnia profits from its young talent."
 BOS_modernize_the_universities:0 "Modernize the Universities"
 BOS_modernize_the_universities_desc:0 "While we won't be able to stop loss of Bosnian students to foreign universities completely, we can still make sure that Bosnia too has renowned schools. Our brightest minds should at least have the opportunity to remain in Bosnia for their education. To move forward, we need to be able to establish specialized industries of our own and stop just being a labor provider for the likes of Germany and France."
 BOS_comply_with_the_saa:0 "Comply with the SAA"
 BOS_comply_with_the_saa_desc:0 "The Stabilization and Association Process is the prelude to the accession of a country to the EU. Reaching this free market must be our most pressing foreign policy goal. Without it, we will be left in the dust, especially as our neighbors will attempt to reach the Union as well. Croats and Serbs in Bosnia will disapprove of being denied the EU advantages in Bosnia if their home countries reach the Union first."
 BOS_trade_with_germany:0 "Trade with Germany"
 BOS_trade_with_germany_desc:0 "Of all European markets, none are so large and comparatively accessible as the well-developed German economy. Germany is already Bosnia's main import and export partner, and to establish new trade missions with German companies will only improve our standing with this European giant. Germany is also a major home of the Bosnian dispora since many left the country during the war in the 1990s."
 BOS_trade_with_serbia:0 "Trade with Serbia"
 BOS_trade_with_serbia_desc:0 "While we can neither forget nor forgive Serbia's transgressions - we all remember Srebrenica -, we need to make a good faith effort to assure permanent reconciliation. The entire continent laughs and sneers at the Balkan peninsula's tendency to engulf itself in war, and it is in both our interests to prove them wrong. Relaxing our eastern border and enabling free trade will be great comfort to the people of Srpska."
 BOS_trade_with_croatia:0 "Trade with Croatia"
 BOS_trade_with_croatia_desc:0 "While the Croats living in Bosnia are less infamously separatist than the Serbs, they still feel considerable attachment to their home countries and are deeply connected to family members on the other side of the border. By relaxing border control and enabling easier passage of goods and people, we will both appease the Croatian government and the Croatian people in Bosnia."
 BOS_a_port_on_the_adriatic_coast:0 "A Port on the Adriatic Coast"
 BOS_a_port_on_the_adriatic_coast_desc:0 "Our coastline on the Adria is infamously short - the damn Croatians stole all of it -, but some 20 kilometers of coastline around the town of Neum still belong to Bosnia. Because of the small size of the settlement, most of our trade has to come through Croatia. But now, with the help of Croatian companies, we can establish the infrastructure necessary to build a seaport of our own."
 BOS_token_concessions_to_the_croat_separatists:0 "Token Concessions to the Croat Separatists"
 BOS_token_concessions_to_the_croat_separatists_desc:0 "Bosnia consists of two political entities, the Federation and the Republika Srpska. While Srpska exclusively caters to the Serbs, the Croats are forced to share an entity with the Bosniaks, much to the dismay of some, who demand the establishment of "Herzeg-Bosnia", a third entity for the Croats. This would utterly destablize the country and give the Croats a tidy border to annex. So let's not."
 BOS_elections_of_2000:0 "Elections of 2000"
 BOS_elections_of_2000_desc:0 "Although the actual winner will be little more than a formality in regards to the overall course for Bosnia, the race between Zlatko Lagumdžija, Alija Izetbegović, Dragan Kalinić and others will still redefine the positions of power in both the federal government and the government of the two subservient political entities. Only when the campaign is concluded can we with legitimacy look to Bosnia's future."
 BOS_reaffirm_federalization:0 "Reaffirm Federalization"
 BOS_reaffirm_federalization_desc:0 "Even under the new government, neither the Federation nor Srpska need feel threatened by our new federal administration. By having our ministers go out there and make some conciliatory speeches, we can make our separatists understand that there is no urgent need for their secessionist ambition."
 BOS_secure_regional_support_for_the_government:0 "Secure Regional Support for the Government"
 BOS_secure_regional_support_for_the_government_desc:0 "With federalism firmly reasserted, we need now look to political allies in both the Federation and Srpska. Only with our two entities in tow can the federal government of Bosnia operate effectively. Such political victories can be achieved through ways both honest and shady, but what matters is that neither entity rebels against us."
 BOS_regional_autonomy_question:0 "Regional Autonomy Question"
 BOS_regional_autonomy_question_desc:0 "What we need ask ourselves is whether the two entities that our federal government oversees still can serve the Bosnian nation in their current shape. If the answer we find is "yes", then they might be emboldened to stand resilient and firm against us. If the answer is "no", they will DEFINITELY be resilient and emboldened against us."
 BOS_foreign_policy_reassessment:0 "Foreign Policy Reassessment"
 BOS_foreign_policy_reassessment_desc:0 "With the home front secure, Bosnia can for now safely look abroad and determine the country's future in the global strategy: Croatia or Serbia? The West or Russia? The choice is important, as it will determine the population's future mood regarding the Bosnian government. Choosing in favor of Russia would also almost certainly be the death of any EU ambitions for Bosnia."
 BOS_way_towards_the_west:0 "Way towards the West"
 BOS_way_towards_the_west_desc:0 "Realistically, western alignment is the only choice for Bosnia. The EU is richer than any Russian alternative, and NATO is stronger than the mediocre alliance system surrounding Moscow. Bosnia will be safer and more prosperous, and the democracy of the Bosnian people will be safer from large scale Russian interference. The west it is."
 BOS_splendid_neutrality:0 "Splendid Neutrality"
 BOS_splendid_neutrality_desc:0 "In order to avoid large scale civil conflict over the issue of international alignment, Bosnia should abstain from favoring either side over the other. This will allow the Bosnian leadership to save face in front of both the Serbian and Croatian populations and governments. It will deny Bosnia the path into either NATO or CSTO, but that a price worth paying."
 BOS_eastern_alignment:0 "Eastern Alignment"
 BOS_eastern_alignment_desc:0 "Although Tito broke with the Soviet Union and led Yugoslavia into neutrality, the ethnic, lingustic and cultural ties between the southern Slavs and Russia remain strong, especially in Serbia. Bosnia could attain a closer relationship with its eastern neighbor were it to approach Russia as its international partner of choice. Such an action will be highly unpopular with the Bosniaks and Croats in the country."
 BOS_path_to_nato_membership:0 "Path to NATO Membership"
 BOS_path_to_nato_membership_desc:0 "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization offers just the kind of military and political assistance the Bosnian government needs. Such a step would assure Bosnia's future as part of the western power bloc and turn it away from the likes of Serbia and Russia. The Serbs will not approve."
 BOS_peaceful_foreign_policy:0 "Peaceful Foreign Policy"
 BOS_peaceful_foreign_policy_desc:0 "We need to take the lessons taught to the world by the history of the likes of Switzerland and Sweden - powerful, democratic and harmonic nations that prosper through their application of diplomatic non-alignment and neutrality in the world. Such a position is just right for Bosnia, as it would allow us to still approach the EU, but will not threaten the Serbs in the country with a potential NATO accession."
 BOS_aggressive_foreign_policy:0 "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 BOS_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "We need to assert a strong Bosnian nationalism, glorifying our struggle for independence and the victorious soldiers of the war in the 1990s. Through this, we will be able to justify authoritarian measures like the reintroduction of conscription and tightened emigration laws to revert the brain drain. This will be viewed as an endorsement of the ethnic Bosniaks and will annoy both Croats and Serbs."
 BOS_seek_big_brothers_approval:0 "Seek Big Brother's Approval"
 BOS_seek_big_brothers_approval_desc:0 "Russia was the leading nation of Eastern Europe since its valiant effort to free the Slavs from the German yoke in 1914. This cultural and geopolitical role hasn't been forgotten either in Moscow or in Sarajevo, and our relationship can be easily rekindled. We need to reach out to Russia and request economic and political assistance for Bosnia."
 BOS_permanent_peace_with_serbia:0 "Permanent Peace with Serbia"
 BOS_permanent_peace_with_serbia_desc:0 "Our relationship with Belgrade is getting better. We need to sign a declaration of friendship between our two nations that will both prevent Srpska independence on one hand and remove the necessity for any Serbs' independence mentality in the first place on the other."
 BOS_join_the_partnership_for_peace:0 "Join the Partnership for Peace"
 BOS_join_the_partnership_for_peace_desc:0 "Bosnia has failed to join NATO's PfP program, the Partnership for Peace. Such an accession would be positively received in the capital cities of our future allies, while also not stoking too much suspicion in those of our potential future adversaries - even Russia is a member of the PfP, after all."
 BOS_approach_the_european_union:0 "Approach the European Union"
 BOS_approach_the_european_union_desc:0 "The European Union of 1992 was the most appealing silver lining on the economic horizon of Eastern Europe's nation since its inception. Almost all countries in Europe have the declared goal to find a part in the EU and its formidable common market - and Bosnia is no different. We must contact Brussels and begin our accession progress."
 BOS_endorse_yugonostalgia:0 "Endorse Yugonostalgia"
 BOS_endorse_yugonostalgia_desc:0 "Yugonostalgia, the melancholic feeling regarding the former united Yugoslavia, is mainly a phenomenon in the richest former Yugoslav republics, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. In Bosnia, where ethnic and religious divides decrease feelings of union rather than strengthening them, this trend doesn't exist. We need to counteract this through concentrated state propaganda."
 BOS_union_of_the_southern_slavs:0 "Union of the Southern Slavs"
 BOS_union_of_the_southern_slavs_desc:0 "In order to restore the great nation that was once Yugoslavia, we need to first restore the feeling of unionism among the Slavic people. We need to call upon all those willing to support us and we need to condemn our enemies that would be willing to stand in our way. This however would be an act of warmongering and no one would appreciate it."
 BOS_resolve_territorial_conflicts:0 "Resolve Territorial Conflicts"
 BOS_resolve_territorial_conflicts_desc:0 "Both the EU and NATO shun - at least nominally - the accession of member states that have ongoing territorial conflicts with their member states. We need to gain assurance that Srpska will not seek annexiation by Serbia in order to appease Brussels and New York."
 BOS_stabilisation_and_association_agreement:0 "Stabilisation and Association Agreement"
 BOS_stabilisation_and_association_agreement_desc:0 "The "Stabilisation and Association Agreement" is a key landmark step in seeking accession into the EU, especially for Balkan countries. It tests several capitalistic aspects of the economy and democratic standpoints of the government in order to assure that the country in question will fit into the greater European political and economic apparatus."
 BOS_intensify_dialogues:0 "Intensify Dialogues"
 BOS_intensify_dialogues_desc:0 "The 'Intensified Dialogues' are the immediate preparation for a country to join NATO. This will not be misread by the west's enemies - any country that intensifies these dialogues will be viewed as a potential adversary in Moscow and Beijing."
 BOS_join_the_european_union:0 "Join the European Union"
 BOS_join_the_european_union_desc:0 "At last, we have fulfilled the European Union's conditions for membership."
