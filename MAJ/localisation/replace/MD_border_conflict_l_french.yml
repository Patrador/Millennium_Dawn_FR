 ### Turkey-Rojava Conflict in Afrin
 TUR_ob_win.1.t:0 "Operation Olive Branch Succeeds!"
 TUR_ob_win.1.desc:0 "Turkish and Free Syrian Army forces have seized the region of Afrin from the YPG and PKK terrorists after the quick encirclement that followed the launch of the operation. Without Afrin, Kurdish forces will likely be unable to carry out major attacks in the proximity of their former stronghold, though the fight does not end here as the PKK, PYD and YPG are sleepless and will continue their fight for perhaps an eternity."
 TUR_ob_win.1.a:0 "The real threat is yet to be addressed..."
 
 TUR_ob_win.2.t:0 "Turkish Forces are Repelled!"
 TUR_ob_win.2.desc:0 "The Turkish devils brand us as terrorists, then march into our land in an attempt to kill hundreds of Kurdish fighters who are fighting for a democratic Syria free of the Daesh threat, and free of Kurdish opression. Afrin was left untouched by Turkish hands as the YPG fought tooth and nail to hold the Turks at their own border, a line in wihch they should have never crossed. They can try all they want to commit genocide against the Kurdish people, but as long we continue the fight against oppression, Turkey will never win."
 TUR_ob_win.2.a:0 "The fight does not end here..."
 
 TUR_ob_lose.1.t:0 "Operation Olive Branch Fails!"
 TUR_ob_lose.1.desc:0 "The push for Afrin has resulted in a strategic failure as the Kurdish terrorists have managed to hold off our forces and drive them from the region. For now, Kurdish forces remain in control of their stronghold in Afrin and can launch terror attacks within our borders at will. We cannot stand for this and we must rethink our strategy immediately if we are to counter these terrorists." 
 TUR_ob_lose.1.a:0 "The fight is not over..."
 TUR_ob_lose.2.t:0 "Afrin Falls to Turkish Forces!"
 TUR_ob_lose.2.desc:0 "The Turks have succeeded in their mission to fight an opponent which has nothing to do with the internal dissent that grows constantly in their own country. We have made it clear from the beginning that all we want is a Kurdistan that is free of opression, and a democratic nation where the people can be heard. This is too much for the Turks, if they want to fight the wrong opponent then let it be so, but if Daesh manages to win this fight across the Levant, blood is on Turkey's hands." 
 TUR_ob_lose.2.a:0 "They will never stop fighting, and neither must we."
 
 TUR_ob_warn.1.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Announces Anti-Kurdish Campaign"
 TUR_ob_warn.1.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has announced that Turkish forces will be deployed to the region of Afrin in an attempt to strangle terrorist forces before they can be born out of the region. The YPG has been fighting Daesh for how long? The Turks will never understand that Kurdish people want only what is right for it's people, but unfortunately they see it as terrorism. If they believe this is something they must do, then by the good grace of god, we will be there to meet their forces with faith and courage, and we will defend ourselves to the death."
 TUR_ob_warn.1.a:0 "We must be ready."
