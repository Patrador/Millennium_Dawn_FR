 POLITICS_PAUL_KAGAME_DESC:0 "When Paul Kagame was 28, he helped topple the government of Uganda. At 36 he overthrew the genocidal Hutu-led government of Rwanda. At 39 he ousted Mobutu of DR Congo, Africa's most corrupt and repressive dictator. Kagame is probably the most successful military leader alive, having won more wars than anyone - all on a shoestring budget. While repressing all opposition at home, the Tutsi general is constantly fixing his eyes on further foreign ambitions, hunting down Hutu rebels and exploiting mineral riches."
