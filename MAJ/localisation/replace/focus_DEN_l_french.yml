 #Army
 DEN_army:0 "Hæren"
 DEN_army_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Army is the land-based military of our country and a vital part of our military as a whole. We should look into ways of expanding its abilities."
 DEN_expand_barracks:0 "Expand the Barracks"
 DEN_expand_barracks_desc:0 "The capacity of our current barracks is woefully inadequate and must be expanded to accomodate our ever-expanding stream of brave recruits!"
 DEN_develop_artillery_models:0 "Develop Artillery Models"
 DEN_develop_artillery_models_desc:0 "Artillery has historically been an important part of the Danish army, and whether we expand into mechanizing our main forces or not, our artillery will always be there to lay down devastating covering fire. For this reason alone we should look into expanding and modernizing them."
 DEN_infantry_equipment_models_1:0 "New Infantry Equipment Models"
 DEN_infantry_equipment_models_1_desc:0 "Our army has been lacking funding for decades and large amounts of it is stuck with ancient equipment. We need to rectify this sad fact immediately!"
 DEN_land_doctrine_1:0 "Land Doctrine I"
 DEN_land_doctrine_1_desc:0 "As a small country, our tactics have always revolved around being smarter, if not outright stronger, than our opponents. Army doctrines are incredibly important for the overall effectiveness of our military encounters."
 DEN_land_doctrine_2:0 "Land Doctrine II"
 DEN_land_doctrine_2_desc:0 "The art of war is changing and we must change with it."
 DEN_close_Frederiksberg_Have:0 "Close Down Frederiksberg Garden"
 DEN_close_Frederiksberg_Have_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Military Academy is situated in Frederiksberg Castle next to the vast natural beauty of Frederiksberg Garden. If we close the Garden off from the public, the resulting expanded training areas vastly improve the effectiveness of the Academy. Of course, this will probably be protested by the public, but isn't the integrity of our nation's military more important than a few angry joggers?"
 DEN_joint_material_command:0 "Establish the Joint Material Command"
 DEN_joint_material_command_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing effort to modernize the army, several of our generals have recommended that we create a new entity to coordinate the purchase of new military equipment. This new Joint Material Command will ensure more effective military spending."
 DEN_hacker_recruitment_drive:0 "Hacker Recruitment Drive"
 DEN_hacker_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Cyberwarfare is the future and, sadly, our efforts in cyberspace could be better. To make matters worse, many qualified cybersecurity experts are joining anarchists and other subversive underground groups rather than our cybermilitary forces. If we're willing to overlook their checkered past, we may be able to recruit some of these hackers for our benefit."
 DEN_refurbish_FAK:0 "Refurbish FAK"
 DEN_refurbish_FAK_desc:0 "The Defence Academy, in Danish 'Forsvarsakademiet' or FAK is an independent entity in the military, which provides education, consultation and research for the benefit of our armed forced. Unfortunately, over time it has developed into a fragmented mess. Overhauling its structure and emphasizing its strategic importance could yield great benefit."
 DEN_streamline_infantry_production:0 "Streamline the Infantry Equipment Production"
 DEN_streamline_infantry_production_desc:0 "As a small country, we cannot depend on the vast industrial powers of some of our neighbours. However, if we streamline the production of our infantry equipment, we can ensure that when we produce something, we produce it cheaper and better than them."
 DEN_FAUK:0 "FAUK"
 DEN_FAUK_desc:0 "The Defence Judge Advocate Corps, in Danish 'Forsvarets Auditørkorps' or FAUK, is the legal branch of the Danish military, responsible for conducting any legal investigations involving the armed forces. If we expand their jurisdiction, we may be better equipped to ensure law and order anywhere our armed forces go."
 #Navy
 DEN_royal_navy:0 "Søværnet"
 DEN_royal_navy_desc:0 "We're situated strategically between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and the Royal Danish Navy has always been key to exercising our control in the area. It is by far the oldest branch of our military, harking all the way back to 1510, but still remains important to this day." 
 DEN_expand_Holmen:0 "Expand Holmen"
 DEN_expand_Holmen_desc:0 "Naval Base Copenhagen, more commonly known as Naval Base Holmen, is our first and largest naval base, dating from the 17th century. Even though it originally occupied the entirety of the water-bound neighbourhood Holmen in Copenhagen, it has since then been reduced to the island of Nyholm. We need to expand the naval base back to its original capacity, even if it will disappoint the many daily visitors."
 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy:0 "Refurbish the Royal Naval Academy"
 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy_desc:0 "At an age of more than 300 years, the Royal Danish Naval Academy has the honor of being the oldest still-existing officers' academy in the world. Unfortunately, even for institutions, with age comes a sneaking decreptitude and the Naval Academy could really use some restructuring."
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR:0 "Establish OPLOG KOR"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR_desc:0 "OPLOG KOR, short for Operative Logistical Support Korsør, is the local support infrastructure for our naval base in Korsør, FLS KOR. The naval base is home to a great part of our navy and as our navy expands more pressure will invariably be put on the support infrastructure. Thus, we should make expanding the OPLOGs a priority!"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_FRH:0 "Establish OPLOG FRH"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_FRH_desc:0 "With OPLOG KOR already expanded, the time has come to expand the infrastructure of our other large naval base in Frederikshavn."
 DEN_streamline_naval_production:0 "Streamline the Naval Production"
 DEN_streamline_naval_production_desc:0 "We're an old seafaring nation and shipbuilding is interweaved into the very soul of our nation. Add to that our knack for figuring out how to improve and innovate and it's clear that we should be able to save on naval costs without having to cut corners on the quality of the equipment."
 DEN_ark_project:0 "The ARK Project"
 DEN_ark_project_desc:0 "The ARK Project is a Danish military project originally aimed at meeting the requirements for maritime transport capacity set by NATO to its members. Dedicating ourselves to the project will prioritize aquiring newer and better transport ships as well as give insight into convoy doctrines."
 DEN_new_ship_models:0 "New Ship Models"
 DEN_new_ship_models_desc:0 "We can't rely on foreign naval technologies forever. Maybe we should boost the budget of our own R&D departments and see if they can get a leg up on the competition."
 DEN_Lyngby_Radio:0 "Lyngby Radio"
 DEN_Lyngby_Radio_desc:0 "Lyngby Radio is a centrepoint of our naval communications. Though mainly used in cooperation with the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC), the radio operators working here have an expertise built up over many years, which would be invaluable in any future RADAR developments."
 DEN_naval_doctrine_1:0 "Naval Doctrine I"
 DEN_naval_doctrine_1_desc:0 "As our navy is our greatest military asset, so, too, must our greatest military theorists concentrate on improving and refining our naval doctrine."
 DEN_naval_doctrine_2:0 "Naval Doctrine II"
 DEN_naval_doctrine_2_desc:0 "We've already made headway into the art of war on the sea, but there's still room for improvements."
 DEN_establish_VFK:0 "Establish VFK"
 DEN_establish_VFK_desc:0 "Our Joint Services Defense Command, or 'Værnsfælles Forsvarskommando', will be the supreme authority of Danish Defence, spanning all three main branches of the Danish armed forces. Situated directly underneath the Ministry of Defense, the establishment of this entity will undoubtedly ensure a much greater degree of cooperation between the armed forces as well as a clearer chain of command."
 #Air Force
 DEN_air_force:0 "Flyvevåbnet"
 DEN_air_force_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Air Force is the youngest of our three professional military branches and was only established after the Second World War. Regardless, the aerial frontier is now more central to modern warfare than ever, and we must not lack behind in this area!"
 DEN_support_Terma:0 "Support Terma"
 DEN_support_Terma_desc:0 "Terma A/S is a Danish technology cooperation situated in Lysby in Jutland. Apart from manufacturing space and satellite technology, they specialize in RADAR equipment, fighter planes, helicopters and a host of other military electronics. Clearly we stand to benefit by supporting their work."
 DEN_Skrydstrup_air_base:0 "Expand Skrydstrup Air Base"
 DEN_Skrydstrup_air_base_desc:0 "Ironically, the air base in Skrydstrup in Southern Jutland was founded by the Nazis during World War II as 'Fliegerhorst Hadersleben'. Today it serves as our Air Force's first line of defense if they should ever decide to visit us again. Just in case, let's expand it."
 DEN_early_fighter_models:0 "Early Fighter Models"
 DEN_early_fighter_models_desc:0 "We don't have a history of great aviation in Denmark and our R&D has been severely lacking on the subject. If we want to kickstart this industry, we need to start by researching some proper planes worth flying."
 DEN_refurbish_air_force_officers_school:0 "Refurbish the Royal Air Force Officers School"
 DEN_refurbish_air_force_officers_school_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Air Force Officers School is the youngest of our great military academies, but is still lagging hopelessly behind other countries' air forces. Let's set aside the economy to bring the School back up to speed with the rest of the air forces in the world."
 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base:0 "Expand Skalstrup Air Base"
 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base_desc:0 "Our air base near Roskilde was previously armed with NIKE rockets and HAWK batteries that contributed massively to our anti-air capabilities on Zealand and whose prime directive was the protection of Copenhagen from air bombardments. These weapons have foolishly been shut down as part of a political austerity measure. That was a mistake - protecting our capital is of utmost importance!"
 DEN_advanced_bomber_models:0 "Advanced Bomber Models"
 DEN_advanced_bomber_models_desc:0 "Our earlier attempts at homegrown military airplane R&D was successful and several advisors are recommending that we expand the program to include bombers."
 DEN_air_doctrine_1:0 "Air Doctrine I"
 DEN_air_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Even the best planes in the world are useless if the pilot doesn't know what he's supposed to do. The strategies of our Air Force need to be written down into actual military doctrines to allow for better educating of the military personnel involved."
 DEN_air_doctrine_2:0 "Air Doctrine II"
 DEN_air_doctrine_2_desc:0 "Now that our air doctrine initiatives are well underway we can divert some of our greatest military minds to support the development of innovative new ways of ruling the skies."
 DEN_Karup_air_base:0 "Expand Karup Air Base"
 DEN_Karup_air_base_desc:0 "Karup in Jutland is home to our largest Air Base, not only the largest in Denmark but the largest in all of Northern Europe. As the pride and joy of our Air Force it reinforces the fact that even though we're a geographically small nation we're more than capable of punching above our weight class. Karup needs to be protected, to be respected - and perhaps even to be expanded."
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production:0 "Streamline the Aircraft Production"
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production_desc:0 "Several of our advisors have recommended that we bring the production of aircrafts for the Air Force home. This would not only bring jobs, but, more importantly, allow us to cut out the middle men and streamline the infrastructure to ensure that we'll soon be able to cover the skies in red and white!"
 #Special Troops
 DEN_establish_SOKOM:0 "SOKOM"
 DEN_establish_SOKOM_desc:0 "The Special Operations Command, or SOKOM, is slated to be the High Command coordinating the deployment of any and all Danish special forces."
 DEN_mobilize_SSR:0 "Mobilize the SSR"
 DEN_mobilize_SSR_desc:0 "The Special Support and Reconnaissance Company, also known as Patrol Company Army Operational Command, is a unit specializing in reconnaissance both remotely and on the ground. Mobilizing them will grant a boost to reconnaissance missions."
 DEN_mobilize_hunter_corps:0 "Mobilize the Hunter Corps"
 DEN_mobilize_hunter_corps_desc:0 "The Hunter Corps, or 'Jægerkorpset' in Danish, is our main special operations force. Their motto, 'Plus esse, quam simultatur', 'More to be than to seem' refers to their understated, humble appearance. Almost nothing is known about the Hunter Corps, or its members, in the Danish public, which keeps the enemies of the country guessing about their true capabilities."
 DEN_mobilize_frogmen:0 "Mobilize the Frogmen"
 DEN_mobilize_frogmen_desc:0 "The Frogmen Corps, or in Danish 'Frømandskorpset', is our maritime special operations force. The Frogmen Corps has extremely exclusive selection training, as seen in the fact that since the Corps was founded in 1957 there has only been a little more than 300 Frogmen - in total. As the elite forces of our strongest military branch, they are a must-have in any enemy encounter."
 DEN_sirius_patrol:0 "The Sirius Patrol"
 DEN_sirius_patrol_desc:0 "The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol is one of the most elite units in the Danish Naval Forces, tasked with long-distance reconnaissance and asserting Danish sovereignty in the most remote parts of the Arctic. Even though its main role is reconnaissance, all members of the Sirius Patrol receive elite combat training as they can at any given point be the first line of defense against attacks on Greenland."
 DEN_sirius_patrol_tt:0 "Gain an elite infantry division in Greenland.\n"
 #Economy
 DEN_abolish_amts:0 "Abolish the Amts"
 DEN_abolish_amts_desc:0 "Many parts of Denmark have room for improvement, but in order to get to that we first need to deal with one of the biggest obstacles for innovation and modernization. The amts are archaic administrative entities at this point, harking all the way back to 1662. If we want efficient policies throughout Denmark we need to replace them with a better system."
 DEN_empower_municipalities:0 "Empower the Municipalities"
 DEN_empower_municipalities_desc:0 "The Danish municipalities are a cornerstone of our Constitution and our country as a whole - they are the ground-level administrative entity, run by people who live in the same neighbourhoods they govern. Their close cooperation will be essential for our future plans."
 DEN_empower_regions:0 "Empower the Regions"
 DEN_empower_regions_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have suggested that the problem with the amts was that they weren't large enough to be of any real use. Instead we should create a new system of a few administrative Danish 'regions' each spanning a large part of Denmark. This would ensure greater focus on large cities as funding isn't swallowed by minor, irrelevant outskirts."
 DEN_natural_gas_deposits:0 "Natural Gas Deposits"
 DEN_natural_gas_deposits_desc:0 "The North Sea is a treasure trove of natural resources. Chief among these are the large deposits of natural gas - if we can renovate the high pressure transmission lines connecting to them it would take some of the pressure off the rest of our energy sources."
 DEN_revitalize_the_outskirts:0 "Revitalize the Outskirts"
 DEN_revitalize_the_outskirts_desc:0 "A large number of municipalities are struggling to maintain their population as more and more people move to the big cities, and have asked for our help. This is an excellent opportunity for us - our fledging military industry has been looking for places to expand away from the pacifist rabble of many of our more urban areas."
 DEN_flere_i_arbejde_2003:0 "Flere i Arbejde"
 DEN_flere_i_arbejde_2003_desc:0 "'Flere i arbejde' was a multipartisan political deal made in 2003 to align the national employment policies toward a greater focus on active job search and away from unemployment benefits."
 DEN_expand_central_government:0 "Expand the Central Government"
 DEN_expand_central_government_desc:0 "The establishment of the regions has led to a much larger degree of cooperation with our central government - so much, in fact, that we are struggling to keep up. Let's enlarge our staff count to ensure that we can handle the added load."
 DEN_north_sea_oil:0 "North Sea Oil"
 DEN_north_sea_oil_desc:0 "A multinational consortium is currently heading the production of oil from our vast deposits in the North Sea, and Denmark is getting a ridiculously low cut of the action. Well, since they're on our territory we set the rules! Let's put the screws on them to ensure that a larger kickback of the crude oil is returned to our national supply."
 DEN_urban_improvement_fund:0 "Urban Improvement Fund"
 DEN_urban_improvement_fund_desc:0 "Most of our population today live in our large cities, with more than 20% of our entire population in Copenhagen alone. Naturally, improving the cities must be our top priority! To that end, we will establish a fund to ensure the continuous expansion and modernization of our big cities."
 DEN_windmill_parks:0 "Windmill Parks"
 DEN_windmill_parks_desc:0 "Vestas Wind Systems are the world's leading producer of windmills and their large windmill parks are the pride and joy of our renewable energy initiatives - putting up a few more will ensure more clean energy to our citizens as well as a lot of great PR with the rest of the climate-conscious world."
 DEN_jutlandic_traffic_mafia:0 "The Jutlandic Traffic Mafia"
 DEN_jutlandic_traffic_mafia_desc:0 "'The Jutlandic Traffic Mafia' is the ironic moniker given to a multipartisan group of Danish MP's who ever since the 80's occasionally strong-armed the rest of the Folketing into approving construction of elaborate freeways throughout Jutland."
 DEN_support_iron_metal_industry:0 "Support the Iron and Metal Industry"
 DEN_support_iron_metal_industry_desc:0 "The Danish Union of Metalworkers, or simply Danish Metal, has been unwilling or unable to supply a large enough workforce for our metalworking industry. A bit of monetary incentive could pave the way for more home-grown factory workers, enabling us to produce more of our steel products at home instead of abroad."

 #Status Quo
 DEN_welfare_state:0 "The Welfare State"
 DEN_welfare_state_desc:0 "The greatest challenge facing us today involves our unique Nordic welfare model. Whether for good or bad, we cannot deny the all-compassing influence of the welfare state, and any challenges to our way of life start there."
 DEN_expand_welfare_state:0 "Expand the Welfare State"
 DEN_expand_welfare_state_desc:0 "The welfare state is a cornerstone of our society, and to touch it would be tantamount to sacrilege! In fact, we should not only protect the welfare state, but expand its reach beyond what it currently covers."
 DEN_balanced_approach:0 "Balanced Approach"
 DEN_balanced_approach_desc:0 "The welfare state is a means, not an end in itself. It can be a blessing or a curse depending on how it is handled. We should approach it cautiously. Maybe what is needed is merely a different way to look at things?"
 DEN_shrink_welfare_state:0 "Shrink the Welfare State"
 DEN_shrink_welfare_state_desc:0 "The welfare state may have started out as a good idea, but have since then grown to become an all-consuming monster of a bureaucracy, which seizes both our freedoms and our money in the name of public welfare. It's time to put our foot down and shrink its reach."
 DEN_appease_unions:0 "Appease the Unions"
 DEN_appease_unions_desc:0 "Historically, the Social Democrat have always had very close ties with the unions, and with the political gains we have made recently, the unions are currently expecting that alliance to benefit them at the forthcoming tripartite negotiations."
 DEN_old_compromises:0 "Old Compromises"
 DEN_old_compromises_desc:0 "Political power in Denmark has historically been switching from the Social Democrats to the Liberals and Conservatives and back again. Only one party has managed to cross the divide and play both sides of the fence: The Social Liberal Party. By showing our willingness to compromise, we can gain more influence than we would in any opposition."
 DEN_new_ideas:0 "New Ideas"
 DEN_new_ideas_desc:0 "The politics of the 'big two' have been stale for some time now and it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell them apart by their politics. What the system needs more than anything is an injection of new, innovative ideas and progressive ideals to breathe new life into the political process."
 DEN_strengthen_industry_ties:0 "Strengthen Industry Ties"
 DEN_strengthen_industry_ties_desc:0 "Several of the largest industry heads have generously supported our party in the past, seeing as they share our vision of fewer regulations and more freedom for businesses and enterprises in Denmark.

We must stem the tide of this malign pluralism and take steps toward promoting our good, old-fashioned Danish way of life."
 DEN_restrict_immigration:0 "Restrict Immigration"
 DEN_restrict_immigration_desc:0 "The first step towards preserving the Danish culture is restricting foreign influences, and the most effective way to do that is to restrict immigration. It may cause potential problems with our demographic distribution but surely it is worth it to protect the Denmark we know and love?"
 DEN_outlaw_hijab:0 "Outlaw the Hijab"
 DEN_outlaw_hijab_desc:0 "For some time now, patriots have voiced their concern that some women - mainly immigrants - are wearing what is widely considered a symbol of religious oppression so openly in our society. They claim that it is 'their own choice' but isn't that exactly what somebody who was forced to wear it would say? Regardless it certainly is very far from Danish culture.

 DEN_revive_folk_high_school_movement:0 "Revive the Folk High Shool Movement"
 DEN_revive_folk_high_school_movement_desc:0 "The Folk School Movement started as an attempt to bring the values of Danish culture to every man and woman willing to attend - a truly noble goal, and one that should be not only preserved but expanded upon! An expanded system of folk high schools will make it possible to rally around the true Danish culture."
 DEN_venerate_country:0 "The Country"
 DEN_venerate_country_desc:0 "It's time to rally to the true foundation of our Danish culture - the country.

Not only can our royal House can trace its roots back to the first kings of Europe, but the Queen herself exudes grace and nobility. Criticized by few, beloved by all, she is the living embodiment of Danish culture and should be treated as such."
 DEN_border_control:0 "Introduce Border Control"
 DEN_border_control_desc:0 "Our party member has for some time now demanded that the government view illegal immigration as the prime evil threatening our society today. As we have recently experienced a surge in support for our cause, perhaps now the machinery of politics will work for us.

 DEN_restrict_greenlandic_autonomy:0 "Restrict Greenlandic Autonomy"
 DEN_restrict_greenlandic_autonomy_desc:0 "The Greenlanders have time and time again shown that their incompetence is simply too great to allow them any degree of self-rule.

She has already made clear that she is more than capable of ruling the country that is hers by birthright and many voices are now demanding that we make it official. However, that would require changing large parts of the Constitution - perhaps it would be easier to draft a new one altogether."
