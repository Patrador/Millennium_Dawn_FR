The amendment is a constant cause of conflict within American politics as to its totality - with the government having successfully banned private ownership of weapons like heavy machine guns and land mines in the past, which some activists believe to be infringing upon the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Second Amendment leads to unfortunate situations where a few of the gun owners abuse their weapons to do harm, forcing the government to focus on cleaning up school shootings, hostage situations, gang crime and robberies instead of trying to bring the country forward."

These reports were also confirmed even by five on-duty police officers across the region.\n\nThe aircraft, which made no sound and was reportedly massive in size, operated at treetop level altitude and was spotted several times between 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning.\n\nThe incident has once more funneled conspiracy theories about secret U.S. Air Force projects or, depending on the conspiracy theorist, an alien invasion or alien control of several world leaders, including the U.S. President [USA.GetLeader]."

Microsoft, especially dominant in the home computer markets with its Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98 operating systems, is always looking to broaden its outreach and the amount of computer programs it controls, arguably so that they can no longer be released on non-Microsoft operating systems.\n\nOne such target for expansion is the Seattle-based Visio Corporation, whose acquisition by Microsoft was initially announced in September of 1999. Visio, which is to become the Visio Division within the Microsoft Business Productivity Group, has especially met appraisal for its programs to generate charts, graphs and other data visualisation for corporate administrators, economic experts and product designers. Microsoft, which is paying 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars for the acquisition which is to be finalized on January 7th, 2000, hopes to strenghten its standing with professionals through the annexiation of Visio."

However, the mother tried not only to flee from communism, but also from her husband, Gonzalez' father, who, still back in Cuba, now made demands to have the boy come back to him. \n\nThere can be no doubt from both an American and a Cuban standpoint that it would follow the law to send the young boy back to his father. But there are both moral and political implications here. Should we doom a young man to communistic oppression? Should we jeopardize the Cuban support for the Democratic Party in the vital key state of Florida? \n\nIt all comes down to Reno's verdict now."

The largest group by descent from a single country are, as is custom since decades, the German Americans at about 12.4% of the population.\nThe census did not gather religious data (in accordance with the secular nature of the U.S. as per the First Amendment), however religion did play a role in the so-called "Utah Controversy", when the state of Utah, which failed to gain a fourth congressional seat by a margin of 80 people, tried to have most Mormons outside of Utah count as Utahns in order to gain the seat that now was given to North Carolina. Utah would later take the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in the case "Utah v. Evans", but ended up losing the case.\nThe population continues to age, with age brackets like 45 to 54 growing by 49% and the age bracket of 85 and older growing by 38%.\nWhen it comes to gender, women still outnumber men, especially because they outnumber men two to one in the 85 years and older bracket.\nSexual orientation, in compliance with policies like 'Don't ask, don't tell', was not documented - much to the dismay of gays and lesbians throughout the country."

Bush, formally unknown Arizona senator John McCain and the Maryland-based African American conservative activist Alan Keyes.\n\nBush took an early lead due to Republican establishment support with notable supporters including George Shultz and Condoleezza Rice. However, a dominant victory in New Hampshire also gave McCain some prominence.\n\nMcCain ended up unable to use the momentum, winning only 7 contests (his home state Arizona as well as Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts). Keyes did even worse, not winning a single contest. The 43 other states as well as D.C. voted for George Bush, helped by McCain's withdrawal on March 9th.\n\nThe Republicans face a bit of ridicule because of the Bushs becoming a 'Presidential Dynasty' akin to the Democratic Kennedys, but George W.

Hall, who was born as Arvo Kusta Halberg, changed his name during the 1930s to escape the U.S. governments blacklist of communists that made it very difficult for them to get employed.\n\nHall continued to rise through the ranks of the CPUSA due to his slave-like obedience to the Soviet leadership (with his political views changing just as often as the ones in Moscow)."

 election_USA.1.t:0 "Election of 2000"
 election_USA.1.d:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2000 was one of the most controversial elections in the history of the United States of America. After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again. In his place, the democrats nominated a relatively young environmental activist and former Senator of Tennessee by the name of Al Gore, while the Republicans sent a classical southern Republican, George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency. Democrats demanded a recount, which could not be granted because of Florida voting systems. The Supreme Court is about to overturn the demand for a recount. What should be done?"
 election_USA.1.o1:0 "No recounts required! Bush!"
 election_USA.1.o2:0 "By popular force: Gore!"
 election_USA.2.t:0 "Election of 2004"
 election_USA.2.d1:0 "After the painful and unlucky defeat in 2000, Al Gore had pulled out of politics to focus on his environmentalist campaigns again. In his place, the democratic party nominated one of its most established political veterans, John Kerry from Massachusetts. \n\nAgainst him, as expected, stands the ruling president, George W. Bush. The focus of the campaign is on terrorism inside and outside the United States, about the conflict in the Middle East, about shady dealings of the administration of Bush and Cheney and about the environment, which Bush was far less fond of protecting than Kerry."
 election_USA.2.d2:0 "After the victory of 2004, Al Gore set to implement environmental and social reforms that were opposed as violating the national spirit and strength by the Republican opposition. \n\nAfter George W. Bush had lost in 2000, he pulled out of politics and rejoined the oil industry in Texas. In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had. The democrats meanwhile had no real opposition. While both former First Lady Hillary Clinton and a young African American senator from Illinois had thought about running a campaign, it was clear that the party stood united behind Al Gore, who is favorite to win against Gingrich."

 election_USA.3.d:0 "After several government crises and conflicts, the Democratic Party wanted a new face that would lead the party into a new age of popularity with young people, ethnic minorities and women; all population groups that traditionally were not drawn towards the Republican Party anyway. This new face came in the shape of Illinois Senator Barack Hussein Obama, who won the primary contests against Bill Clinton's wife and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Republican contests were also fierce, with the hardline faction finally losing out to the moderate fiscal conservatives around Vietnam veteran John McCain. \n\nOn election night, it seems like the Democrats, whose election slogan 'Yes, we can!' is heard across the country, might have the edge by as many as ten million votes. But who knows who could win?"

 election_USA.4.t:0 "Election of 2012"
 election_USA.4.d:0 "After a relatively satisfying first term in office, it was quite clear that the Democratic Party would stand behind its incumbent president Barack Obama for the 2012 Presidential Election. The Republican Party had to readjust after the gamble to mix radical and moderate Republicans had failed with the McCain-Palin ticket of 2008.\n\nThe Republicans went through a primary process with many voters from many parts of the Republican Party, from strict christians like Rick Santorum to Rick Perry to libertarian approaches like the one of Ron Paul. The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."

 election_USA.5.t:0 "Election of 2016"
 election_USA.5.d1:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 might have been one of the most heated and ideologically charged political showdowns of the 21st Century. The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"
 election_USA.5.d2:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has become a battle of two wings of populism.\n\nAfter the Democratic Nomination had been a close race that once more ended up seeing Hillary Clinton as the loser, as before in 2008; the Republican race quickly had become dominated by a far-right rhetoric battle between Donald Trump and similar-minded contestants like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nNow, both candidates promise to battle Wall Street influences and to give back America to the people. Who will it be? The independent senator, legend among left-wing progressives, from small Vermont, Bernie Sanders; or the successful and famous businessman from New York City, Donald Trump?"
 election_USA.5.d3:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been described as the 'battle of the sleeper agents' by a far-left online commentator. Both Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, the two major candidates, are hugely unpopular and are booed by wings of their own party for their uncharismatic behavior. Both the \"Sanders Progressives\" and the \"Trump Nationalists\" hate their party's candidate and are looking into alternatives, like the Greens, the Libertarians and the Constitutionalists. Who will it be among the 'sleeper agents' then? Cruz or Clinton?"
 election_USA.5.d4:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a lopsided affair, comparable to the Reagan, Nixon and Roosevelt landslides. Where the Democrats managed to bring a hugely popular progressive candidate, Bernie Sanders, into the mix; the Republicans failed to nominate a unifying candidate and went with Ted Cruz - a man that was described with flattering words like 'vindictive', 'straight-up evil' or 'the anti christ' even among fellow conservatives for his behavior of flip-flopping.\n\nThe polls are clear, Sanders is favored by a near 10% edge - but the electoral college is known to be a mischievous mistress. Can Cruz win?"
 election_USA.5.d5:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been titled 'battle of sociopaths' by left-wing TV host Bill Maher. Indeed it seems that both Republican candidate Marco Rubio and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are unpopular, uncharismatic and pragmatic - but no one doubts that both of them have a certain talent as politicians.\n\nSo, which uninspiring, uncharismatic sociopath will it be? Marco Rubio from Florida or Hillary Clinton from New York?"
 election_USA.5.d6:0 "'I have never witnessed such a weak political performance, and that is saying something', neo-nazi leader Richard Spencer wrote about the first debate of the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nIndeed, there is not much to be had for far-right voters when looking at the battle of two moderates, comparable to the 1992 election between Clinton and Bush Sr.\n\nThis time, Democratic candidate for nomination Clinton - but the female one - failed to overcome a far-left challenger in the form of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders and Rubio, apart from the far right criticism, have both been praised by the media for their respective campaigns that very much focussed on issues rather than mudslinging. 'If this holds up, we might actually restore a political discourse', Bill O'Reilly commented on the election race.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
 election_USA.5.d7:0 "'Kasich versus Clinton. If that sounds boring, wait until you see it.', TV show host Bill Maher snarked at the candidates the two major political parties chose.\n\nThe US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a shock to both far left and far right voters. Both campaigns have super moderate candidates, both campaigns have largely abstained from mudslinging moves, both campaigns have been described as being lead by 'corrupt kleptocrats' by an MSNBC commentator.\n\nThat sounds demotivating, but one these needs to be president. So let's go for it! Who will it be? Clinton or Kasich?"
 election_USA.5.d8:0 "'This had to have been the most left-wing campaigns I ever saw in my life, it's horrible', Ann Coulter complained on Fox News about the second Presidential Debate of the 2016 US Election.\n\nA far left Democrat, Bernie Sanders, meets a very moderate fiscal Republican, John Kasich, in the arena of the longest and most expensive election of not only American but also world history.\n\nSanders slashed Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for his stance on Planned Parenthood and his cowardly mannerisms when dealing with big business, while Kasich called Vermont senator Sanders out for the very extended gun rights in his home state, thus making Sanders' gun control platform one of hipocrisy.\n\n'This campaign has been highly productive and interesting', a British foreign policy observer commented on the BBC. The global and internal interest is now reaching its peak on election day. Who will win?"
