 Militia_Bat: "Milice"
 Militia_Bat_desc: "Bataillon de milice à pied. Les unités de milice se caractérisent par le fait qu'elles disposent de moins d'équipements lourds et de kits de communication que l'infanterie normale. Cela les rend très mobiles et efficaces en terrain difficile, mais elles se fondent rapidement en terrain plat contre un adversaire blindé."

 L_Inf_Bat: "Infanterie légère"
 L_Inf_Bat_desc: "Infanterie légère sans transports. On en voit rarement sur le champ de bataille moderne, mais il existe des unités spécialisées en terrain très difficile comme la jungle et les montagnes - où elles sont très efficaces. Elles peuvent également être utiles comme garnisons urbaines."
 Mot_Inf_Bat: "Infanterie motorisée"

 L_Air_Inf_Bat: "Infanterie légère aéroportée"
 L_Air_Inf_Bat_desc: "Airborne Light Infantry are elite Infantry, with their special training in Aerial Insertion via paradrops from Transport Aircraft or with Transport Helicopters. They can rapidly respond to emergencies from afar, and can be inserted behind enemy lines to take vital objectives ahead of the main army advance. Their mode of transport puts strict limits on the amount of heavy equipment they can carry, though."

They can rapidly respond to emergencies from afar, and can be inserted behind enemy lines to take vital objectives ahead of the main army advance. Their Utility Vehicles gives them great mobility upon insertion, and allows them bring more heavy equipment into battle. It is however, much more logistically demanding to paradrop them together with vehicles."

They can rapidly respond to emergencies from afar, and can be inserted behind enemy lines to take vital objectives ahead of the main army advance. Their specially designed Light Armored Personell Carriers gives them great mobility upon insertion, and allows them bring much more heavy equipment into battle than lighter Airborne forces.

They can rapidly respond to emergencies from afar, and can be inserted behind enemy lines to take vital objectives ahead of the main army advance. Their specially designed Light Infantry Fighting Vehicles gives them great mobility, and allows them to fight on equal terms against normal mechanized formations. It is however, extremely logistically demanding to paradrop them together with their IFV's. As of 2017, only Russia has ever operated such forces."

 Mech_Marine_Bat: "Infanterie de marine mécanisée"
 Mech_Marine_Bat_desc: "Mechanized Marine Infantry are elite Infantry, with special training in amphibious operations, such as river-crossings, operation in swamps, and amphibious invasions.
