Selon l'ABC's 7:30 Report, les graines du défi entre Gillard et le candidat Rudd ont été semés par des poids lourds de la faction Victorienne (Bill Shorten et le sénateur David Feeney), qui ont reçu le soutien de Mark Arbib. Feeney et Arbib ont discutés d'un possible intérêt d'une confrontation politique avec Gillard au matin du 23 Juin. Ils ont pu dénombrer un nombre assez conséquent de soutien pour tenter une confrontation face à Gillard. Les avis défavorables aux parti Travailliste et à Rudd en personne ont été attribués à plusieurs facteurs, notamment prévu dans le Programme Isolationniste Australien, un retard important du programme de réduction des émissions de CO2, la volonté d'introduire des censures pour Internet, la proposition d'une taxe sur les profits appliqués aux ressources Australiennes et l'élection de Tony Abbott comme leader de l'opposition. Des membres du parti Travailliste ont admis que les intentions de vote pour le parti ont chutés de 30% dans certains secteurs du pays, ce qui si cela se répercute à d'autres endroit pourrait cause la perte du parti aux prochaines élection."

Former state minister Alannah MacTiernan reported a consistent message from voters at doorstops that they would not vote for federal Labor later in the year, and called for Gillard to accept that she could not win an election and to stand down. Later in March, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals—called "shambolic" by a key crossbencher—Chief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon confirmed that Labor Party members were "looking at the polls and expressing concerns". On 21 March at 1pm AEDST, former Labor leader Simon Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Kevin Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. He was critical of Gillard and treasurer Wayne Swan for not communicating effectively with voters. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from Cabinet and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm AEDST that afternoon. Just 10 minutes prior to the scheduled ballot, Rudd announced that he would not stand in the ballot."

By 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard's position as leader was plunged into doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus, as well as persistently bad opinion polling that indicated Labor could be left with the low number of 40 seats in the House of Representatives. ABC News reported that "some former staunch supporters" now held the view that Gillard could not win the upcoming election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified former Leader Kevin Rudd as the only feasible replacement. The political editor of The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June that Rudd had been "mobbed" by members of the public in Geelong on 7 June 2013, and that he was "expected to be returned to the ALP leadership". On 26 June, rumours began to spread that supporters of Rudd were circulating a caucus petition calling for a vote to challenge Gillard for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News Australia that afternoon, Gillard told interviewer David Speers that she had not seen the rumoured petition, and jokingly called it the "political equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster". She also said that nobody had approached her to advise they intended to challenge her. Gillard then proceeded to call a leadership election for 7:00pm that evening in order to end the speculation, declaring that she would retire from politics if she lost, and called on any potential challenger to make the same commitment.Kevin Rudd announced in a press conference shortly afterwards that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost."

The new rules make it more difficult to change leaders and require a ballot of the party membership on contested leadership spills. The new rules encourage the parliamentary party to only nominate one candidate, to avoid a month-long ballot of the general party membership. The new rules are controversial, however, and have been publicly criticised by ALP Senator Stephen Conroy and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Nominations opened at a parliamentary party meeting on Friday 13 September 2013, and remained open for a week. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten formally nominated.

After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us'. Michelle Grattan, writing in The Conversation, argued that the 'narrow margin' of the vote left the party Leader 'deeply vulnerable to later destabilisation'.

 britain_decision.1.d:0 "The Falkland Islands have been a point of contention between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina for decades, with Argentina formally laying claim to the island archipelago (as well as neighboring South Georgia) in 1833.\n\nThe Falklands were first colonized by France in 1764 with a settlement on the eastern island, which was joined by a British settlement on the western one in 1766. However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Mavlinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta. There is really no reason why they should be Argentinian, but having a country that owes Britain a favor could be good in the long run..."

 india.1.d:0 "India Airlines Flight 814 (commonly known as IC 814) had been en route from Kathmandu, Nepal to Delhi, India on December 24th, 1999, when it was hijacked.\n\nThe hijackers took control of the airplane shortly after it left Nepali airspace and entered Indian sovereign territory. The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatizing and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparantly belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages. All of them - except for the man that had been murdered - were brought back to India in relatively good physical health."

[Root.GetLeader]'s proposed reform also included the adoption of a new national anthem and the proclamation of a 'Second Republic'."
 mauritania.2.o1:0 "An excellent initiative."
 mauritania.3.t:0 "DNI Ends With Agreement"
 mauritania.3.d:0 "The National Inclusive Dialogue has ended with an agreement by the government and moderate opposition to call for a referendum, something that has been sought since 2010. Back then the proposal didn't necessarily include a flag change for Mauritania, but was instead purely based around removing the Senate, two limit term and 75 age limit for the presidency. Currently the referendum to pass proposals put forward at the Conference is slated for late 2016, but if the National Assembly has trouble going forward, it could be pushed into 2017."
 mauritania.3.o1:0 "Great."
 mauritania.4.t:0 "Opposition Calls for Referendum Boycott"
 mauritania.4.d:0 "Leaders of the Mauritanian opposition parties, whether they are members of the National Forum for Democracy and Unity, the Rally of Democratic Forces or the National Union for Democracy, announced the boycott of our approaching referendum. The decision was revealed just yesterday during a joint press conference. Now scheduled for early 2017, the national vote seeks approval of several decisions taken during the political dialogue, itself boycotted by the overwhelming majority of opposition parties. Mauritanians are called upon, among others, to advise on the abolition of the Senate and certain institutions, the creation of regional councils and changes to national symbols."
 mauritania.4.o1:0 "Disgraceful."
 mauritania.5.t:0 "Referendum Cancelled"
 mauritania.5.d:0 "Announced with great pomp by President [Root.GetLeader] himself, the popular referendum to approve constitutional changes contained in the resolutions of the national inclusive dialogue from October will ultimately not take place. These changes included radical moves to abolish the senate, create decentralised regional councils and modify the flag and national anthem. This change of high importance, revealed at the end of a meeting between the President and senators still arouses a stir. Thus, in place of popular consultation, the Mauritanian authorities decided to limit themselves to the vote of the Parliament sitting in congress to validate the reforms. This decision is motivated mostly by a supposedly 'difficult economic situation', a truth that the President himself now seems to recognise."
 mauritania.5.o1:0 "To Parliament it is then."
 mauritania.6.t:0 "Debate Begins in National Assembly"
 mauritania.6.d:0 "The debate on constitutional changes has begun in our lower house, the National Assembly. Alongside those which will remove the Senate from its position of upper house and establish regional councils throughout Mauritania, Parliament shall also debate the proposal to change our national flag. Protests have been called for around the country and radical opposition members refuse to accept any measures from the President's ruling party."
 mauritania.6.o1:0 "Ok."
 mauritania.7.t:0 "Flag Presented to National Assembly"
 mauritania.7.d:0 "Several photos have now been published from within the relatively behind-closed-doors debate in Mauritania's National Assembly, showing the Minister of Defence presenting what the proposed flag looks like for those looking to vote on the issue."
 mauritania.7.o1:0 "Interesting."
 mauritania.8.t:0 "National Assembly Votes"
 mauritania.8.d:0 "The National Assembly in its plenary session yesterday, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Mohamedould Boilil, adopted by secret vote Constitutional Bill 118/17, revising the 1991 constitution of Mauritania and its amending texts. During the debate, members of our lower house discussed the legality of the proposed revision, the national flag 'improvements', the abolition of the Senate and various other amendments that President [Root.GetLeader] and his ruling party hope to enact sooner rather than later. For our head of state, this is certainly a great victory. However, the bill must still pass through the Senate or else it will surely go to a national referendum as initially suggested."
 mauritania.8.o1:0 "Wonderful."
 mauritania.9.t:0 "Senate Rejects Changes"
 mauritania.9.d:0 "Mauritania's senate rejected a contentious constitutional amendment on its own abolition and the alteration of the national flag to better represent those who battled for independence from France. 33 Senators out of 56 voted against the package, the President of the Senate stated not long ago. The rejection comes after lawmakers in our lower house passed the proposed measures more than a week ago, with full support from the ruling party. The amendment is therefore definitively defeated by the upper house, and hence it is up to the President to decide whether to continue by way of a referendum."
 mauritania.9.o1:0 "Traitors."
 mauritania.10.t:0 "President Vows Referendum"
 mauritania.10.d:0 "His party's amendments to Mauritania's constitution will be put to a referendum as quickly as possible, the President said today. The proposal to modify the constitution, which has been in force since 1991, was approved by lawmakers in the lower house but rejected by senators earlier this month. 'Due to this rejection, we have arrived at an impasse. But there is one way out: we will hold a referendum', said President [Root.GetLeader] at a press conference. The government has a majority in both chambers, but 24 ruling party senators voted against the measure, highlighting what the President said was a 'dysfunction in our democracy'."
 mauritania.10.o1:0 "To the polls it is!"
 mauritania.11.t:0 "Referendum Campaign Begins"
 mauritania.11.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader] launched a campaign on Friday for a constitutional referendum boycotted by opposition figures who call the vote a smokescreen to keep the ruling party in power. The boycott movement draws broad political support from Islamists and anti-slavery activists, all of whom oppose measures including abolishing the Senate and changing the national flag. More than 1.4 million Mauritanians are eligible to vote on the constitutional changes, set to be voted on in the very near future."
 mauritania.11.o1:0 "Ok."
 mauritania.12.t:0 "Referendum Succeeds"
 mauritania.12.d:0 "On a turnout of 53.73 percent of the 1.4 million Mauritanians eligible to vote, 85 percent yesterday voted 'yes' to abolition of the Senate and changes to the country's flag, the national electoral commission said today. President Aziz said the changes would bring our nation 'peace, security, stability and development' and said the boycott movement existed 'only on paper and social media'. The opposition has stated it would not recognise the results of this referendum, denouncing it in a statement today as an electoral farce, also adding that people had 'clearly rejected the constitutional amendments'. Nevertheless, the ruling party's goal has finally been achieved and Mauritania can be placed back on the path of progress towards a stronger future amongst countless threats."

But that is exactly what happened: With several severe and sweeping changes to the rights of states, all American states have been turned into monarchies under authoritarian dukes - and these United Duchies also managed to abolish the Supreme Court, the House of Representatives and the Office of President, uniting all powers in the Senate - which is now controlled by not two senators per state, but by one 'Imperial Legate', handpicked by the respective duke. The United Duchies operate under the concept of 'The Vote of 30', where at least 30 legates have to agree to exercise the otherwise unchecked power of this new self-proclaimed 'Grand Council'."

Singh was subsequently shot dead by Roque from his truck with a .380 handgun. Roque fled the scene and, twenty minutes later, tried to kill another person, a Lebanon-born store clerk .\nAfter failing at this assassination attempt, Roque ended his terror spree at his own former residence, now taken up by an Afghan family, firing shots at the building but causing no casualties.

Karzai, initially a supporter of the Taliban government, started opposing their increasingly fascistic authoritarianism from 1996 onwards and fled to a United Nations embassy. In Pakistani Quetta, he founded an Anti-Taliban force together with his father and brother in 1997. He funded and armed Northern Alliance forces and sent financial support to Taliban victims and resistance forces within Afghanistan, all the while getting in contact with CIA operatives.\n\nIn 1999, Karzai's father, the Khan of the Pashtun Popalzai people, was assassinated by the Taliban in an attack which Karzai himself, now Khan, barely survived.

The largest group by descent from a single country are, as is custom since decades, the German Americans at about 12.4% of the population.\nThe census did not gather religious data (in accordance with the secular nature of the U.S. as per the First Amendment), however religion did play a role in the so-called "Utah Controversy", when the state of Utah, which failed to gain a fourth congressional seat by a margin of 80 people, tried to have most Mormons outside of Utah count as Utahns in order to gain the seat that now was given to North Carolina. Utah would later take the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in the case "Utah v. Evans", but ended up losing the case.\nThe population continues to age, with age brackets like 45 to 54 growing by 49% and the age bracket of 85 and older growing by 38%.\nWhen it comes to gender, women still outnumber men, especially because they outnumber men two to one in the 85 years and older bracket.\nSexual orientation, in compliance with policies like 'Don't ask, don't tell', was not documented - much to the dismay of gays and lesbians throughout the country."

 usa_decision.1.d:0 "The idea of a king of the United States is as old as the country itself, with people like Alexander Hamilton, one of the country's founding fathers, proposing electing presidents to life terms. Only George Washington's relentless fight for presidents to pass on power voluntarily - which was eventually made into actual law in form of the 22nd Amendment - made sure that the U.S. would not only have a republican tradition, but furthermore one of presidential term limits.\nNow, monarchism has resurged and the people demand a King of America. Handing the crown back to the English is not an option, so there are essentially three choices: Give the crown to a traditional candidate, to a cultural candidate, or give it to an accomplished candidate.\nOf course, the descendants of George Washington first come to mind when talking about a king. Paul Emory Washington of San Antonio is the first president's closest living descendant and would make a fine figurehead for a royal order of power. But you could also go for a candidate of America's culture, the culture of capitalism. Donald Trump is a businessman who loves money and has a sense of grandeur - specifically what this country needs. He would definitely be a reasonable, respected and uncontroversial leader. The last option would be an actually accomplished candidate. Someone who has dedicated their life to the country in form of military service."

 election_USA.1.d:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2000 was one of the most controversial elections in the history of the United States of America. After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again. In his place, the democrats nominated a relatively young environmental activist and former Senator of Tennessee by the name of Al Gore, while the Republicans sent a classical southern Republican, George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency. Democrats demanded a recount, which could not be granted because of Florida voting systems. The Supreme Court is about to overturn the demand for a recount. What should be done?"

In his place, the democratic party nominated one of its most established political veterans, John Kerry from Massachusetts. \n\nAgainst him, as expected, stands the ruling president, George W. Bush. The focus of the campaign is on terrorism inside and outside the United States, about the conflict in the Middle East, about shady dealings of the administration of Bush and Cheney and about the environment, which Bush was far less fond of protecting than Kerry."
 election_USA.2.d2:0 "After the victory of 2004, Al Gore set to implement environmental and social reforms that were opposed as violating the national spirit and strength by the Republican opposition. \n\nAfter George W. Bush had lost in 2000, he pulled out of politics and rejoined the oil industry in Texas. In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had. The democrats meanwhile had no real opposition. While both former First Lady Hillary Clinton and a young African American senator from Illinois had thought about running a campaign, it was clear that the party stood united behind Al Gore, who is favorite to win against Gingrich."

The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."

The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"

Can Cruz win?"

'If this holds up, we might actually restore a political discourse', Bill O'Reilly commented on the election race.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
