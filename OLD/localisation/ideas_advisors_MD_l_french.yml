 advisor_DEN_daniel_carlsen:0 "Daniel Carlsen"
 advisor_DEN_daniel_carlsen_desc:0 "The extreme right in Denmark has traditionally been small and scattered, with the Danish National Socialist Movement being treated more like a joke than a viable political movement. The situation became even stranger when a 17-year-old Daniel Carlsen joined the movement, according to himself because 'they were the only organisation who wanted to deport all immigrants, not talk about integration'. Despite his young age, Carlsen quickly made a name for himself appearing in a number of articles portraying him in mainstream media - and granting the Movement the kind of press attention that it hadn't seen for years. The success was short-lived however, as in 2011 he left the Movement and founded his own Party - the Party of the Danes - aiming for the political influence that he felt the Movement lacked. After attempting, and failing, at being elected to both local and national political office, Carlsen eventually left politics in 2017, causing his party to disband when nobody wished to succeed him as leader."

Not content to let that happen, Jan Falck-Schmidt spent the next two years single-handedly funding a new, revived business, the Falck Schmidt Defence Systems or FSDS, which would be wholly focused on producing military equipment for large-scale conflict. Since reviving the company in 2007, Falck-Schmidt and FSDS has experienced explosive growth in a very short amount of time, quelling any naysayers who would argue that there is no flourishing weapons industry in Denmark. As for the connection between his ancestor's rescue services and his own weapons manufacturing, Falck-Schmidt himself describes it as 'FSDS still save lives – now through our products and services, which aim to secure the lives and safe return of our soldiers.'"

His most notable project is the so-called 'PkW-Maut', a road toll on Germany's autobahn system which is famous for its lack of a general speed limit, making it a path of transportation of choice for both Germans and foreigners alike.

Gauland became one of the three leading co-founders of the Election Alternative 2013, which ended up becoming the AfD. Whereas the other two, Konrad Adam and Bernd Lucke, were closer to the neo-liberal spectrum, Alexander Gauland was the leader of a national conservative school of thought within the AfD and would eventually find an ally in Frauke Petry. The two ended up eliminating Bernd Lucke in an internal power struggle, with Petry taking party leadership and Gauland becoming federal spokesman. Gauland's and Petry's faction ended up securing lots of popular support, with the AfD scoring as high as 24% of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt. In Gauland's home state Brandenburg, the result was still a considerable 12.2%. Gauland continues to guide AfD policy from behind the scenes, notably protecting controversial orator Björn Höcke from many inner-party consequences for Höcke's pro-nazi speeches."

In 2013, after the FDP failed to re-qualify for the Federal Assembly, the CDU and the SPD renewed their alliance and Steinmeier became one of Germany's leading ministers once more.

 advisor_USA_ralph_nader_desc:0 "Environmentalist and author Ralph Nader is an iconic figure within the American green and leftist scene. Nader ran for President of the United States several times, including 1996 and 2000, when he had the endorsement of the American Green Party. Environmental issues, as well as electoral reform, where among his spearhead political goals. He got 685,000 votes in 1996 and 2.8 million votes in 2000, with the fact that he probably served as a spoiler candidate making George W. Bush win the Presidential Election in 2000 due to Nader's votes in Florida not benefitting the Democrats being probably his most notable political achievement."
